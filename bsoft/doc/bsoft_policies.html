      <h1>Coding style</h1>
Bsoft is written to facilitate the rapid development of image and
molecular processing applications. The coding style is kept simple and
designed to avoid ambiguities. There is a certain formalization and
discipline required to code this way, as laid out in the following
guidelines:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Modularity:
        <ul>
          <li>Keep globals to a minimum: The main code in Bsoft has only one
				package-wide global meant mostly for reporting purposes,
				&quot;verbose&quot;.</li>
          <li>Separate program front ends from functionality: In Bsoft, each
				program is viewed as an user interface to process options and drive
				processing. The Bsoft library can therefore be used in the scope of
				any program.<br />
          </li>
          <li>Encapsulate units of functionality in actual functions:
				In Bsoft I attempt to write each function doing only a specific task.</li>
          <li>Every source file in the library has its own header file
				(don't merge header files!). E.g.: utilities.c and utilities.h.</li>
          <li>Separate I/O from processing: All the functions reading
				and writing files and dealing with specific formats feed into a small
				number of interface functions:
          <ul>
            <li>Images: read_img and write_img</li>
            <li>Molecules: read_molecule and write_molecule</li>
            <li>Models: read_model and write_model</li>
            <li>Parameters: read_project and write_project</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Generality:
        <ul>
          <li>Only four forms of information, each with associated
				objects (structures or classes) in the code encapsulating all the relevant data:
            <ul>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>Molecules</li>
            <li>Models</li>
            <li>Parameters</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Every function is written to deal with all incarnations of the
			data form it processes. For images, this means that every function
			needs to address all data types. For molecules, both atomic coordinate
			and sequence data are encoded in the same structural hierarchy, and
			each function needs to take this into account.<br />
          </li>
          <li>A typical function should be written to provide a general
			solution to a problem posed, rather than just returning a specific
			result.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Command line option handling:
        <ul>
          <li>Old model: The original Bsoft option handling was managed
			in typical Unix fashion as single letter tags followed in some cases
			by an option value or argument (using the getopt function).</li>
          <li>New model: The use of single letter tags proved to be too
			restrictive as Bsoft grew, and a new mechanism was introduced allowing
			the user to use truncated versions of long option tags provided they were
			unambiguous. This is largely compatible with the old style options as
			long as a space is used between the option tag and value. <br />
          </li>
          <li>New model and the usage block: This model uses the &quot;usage&quot;
			block of strings to determine option mappings, making the design of the
			usage strings important, as set out in the following rules:
          <ul>
            <li>Any line starting with '-' is assumed to indicate an option
				description.</li>
            <li>The option tag can only be 15 characters long.</li>
            <li>The option tag must be separated from the example value
				by a whitespace.</li>
            <li>The presence of an example value indicates that the
				option requires a value.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>New model mechanism: The command line argument list is parsed
			for options indicated by '-' as the first character. An argument deemed
			an option tag is scanned against the usage block to find the full tag
			and determine whether it takes a value. The option tag-value pairs are
			stored in a linked list and returned. These tag-value pairs are then
			evaluated to set command-line parameters.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Error handling:
        <ul>
          <li>Function return values: Functions in the Bsoft package returns
			three types of values, where each can be used as an indication of an error:
          <ul>
            <li>An integer used as error code: Error codes are always less
				than zero.</li>
            <li>A calculated value: An error may be indicated as an
				implausable value for the return variable.</li>
            <li>A pointer to a structure: A NULL return value indicates an
				error.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Handling: To make an error condition as useful as possible, the
			point of failure in each function in the calling hierarchy should be
			identified by propagating the error condition back to the top level.
			This means that an error should not let the program exit at a low level
			function.</li>
          <li>Warnings: A warning is required to indicate an unexpected
			condition, or a corrective action that may be counter to what the user
			expects, but mostly a non-fatal condition.<br />
          </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Memory tracking:
          <ul>
            <li>All memory is allocated and deallocated explicitly, usually 
			within the function of use, unless the function returns an allocated structure.</li>
            <li>In previous versions of Bsoft, memory allocation and deallocation 
			were tracked and unaccounted instances reported for debugging purposes.</li>
            <li>With expanded conversion to C++ objects, memory tracking is now 
			done with a tool such as <a href="http://valgrind.org" target="_blank">valgrind</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Image processing model:
          <ul>
            <li>An image is read as a whole, processed, and the output written
              as a whole. This ensures modularity in the code, avoiding mixing I/O
              and processing issues. Due to the possibly prohibitive size of a
              multi-image file, a facility has been provided to access individual
            images from a multi-image file.</li>
            <li>Functions may process image data in place (i.e., replacing the
              old data) to limit memory requirements, or generate new image
            structures, depending on the requirements of the algorithm.</li>
            <li>Very large images can be divided into tiles, processed and reassembled.<br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Documentation:
        <ul>
		  <li>Bsoft used to have its own documentation system, but it is now switched
		  to a common format to be able to use the
		  <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> documentation generator</li>
          <li>The comment block must precede the function and start with
			&quot;/**&quot; and end with &quot;**/&quot; on their own lines.</li>
          <li>All keywords within the block must start with &quot;@&quot; as the
			first character on a line.</li>
          <li>Many keywords can be used, with the following typical:
          <ul>
            <li>@brief</li>
            <li>@param</li>
            <li>@return</li>
            <li>@file</li>
            <li>@author</li>
            <li>@date</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>

      <h1> Image file formats</h1>
		The varieties of image formats and even greater varieties of programs
		producing files of these formats, mean that problems are encountered
		because the programmers did not adhere to a complete and up to date
		specification of a format, and typically took shortcuts to avoid having
		to deal with all the issues included in a file format. This generates
		problems such as poor data type support, omission of statistical
		information, and even garbage in some fields which make well-behaved
		programs crash. Here are some of the policies in Bsoft dealing with
		such sloppiness in image format handling:
      <ul>
        <li>The principle in Bsoft is that of access to all images,
			regardless of format. The notion of an image format converter as a standalone
			functionality is therefore considered outdated.<br />
        </li>
        <li>The Bsoft policy is to adhere as closely as possible to the file
			format specification. The priority is therefore to follow published
			specifications, and then to try to deal with the I/O of other
			packages. In the case of TIFF files, Bsoft provides for many datatypes
			(including short and float) described in the version 6 specification.<br />
        </li>
        <li> The image input functions in Bsoft attempts to clean up image 
			header problems as best they can, and
			often such problems experienced with other programs can be resolved by
			passing it through a Bsoft program such as &quot;bimg&quot;.</li>
        <li>Endianness is handled on reading images based on the byte order found
			in particular header fields. When writing images, the native byte order
			of the processor is imposed.</li>
        <li>The data type is preserved as far as possible, changed only on
			user request (option) or when the receiving file format does not
			support the data type.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Due to numerous problems encountered with reading date and time
			fields in image files, Bsoft programs now only write the date and time
			into these fields.</li>
        <li>Labels and titles in image headers may contain garbage with
			control characters detrimental to program execution. Bsoft programs
			write their own strings into these fields.</li>
      </ul>
