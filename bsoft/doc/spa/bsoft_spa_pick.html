<h1>Particle Picking</h1>
<h2>1. Selecting a box size</h2>
<p>All of the projection-matching and reconstruction involves multiple
Fourier transforms per particle. It is therefore a good idea to find
a box size that transforms fast (Note that simply expanding the image
size to a power-of-two size does not necessarily mean the fastest transformation).
The program <b>bfft</b> has an option to test the speed of Fourier
transformation for different image sizes:<br />
<div id="command"><p>bfft -test 2,250,260</p></div>

<p>The FFTW3 library used for Fourier transformation has an optimization
capability that is typically included when it plans for a particular
size transform. This can be switched on for the tests:</p>

<p>Now the planning time (Ptime) is much longer, but the execution time (Etime)
is much shorter. The differences in execution time between the different sizes
are also smaller, but still significant to do this test to pick a box size.</p>
<br />
<h2>2. Picking particles in bshow</h2>
<p>The fastest way to pick particles is to open a parameter (STAR) file
for all the micrographs in <b>bshow</b>. To activate
the creation of boxes for picking, click on the boxing tool in the tool
panel (menu item &quot;Window/Tools&quot;). This will bring up a dialog box
where the particle box size and bad area radius can be set.
A typical particle can be selected and the box size set appropriately
(the bad area radius is usually about a quarter or third of the box size).
All the particles can be picked (left
button) and deleted (shift-left button), and bad areas selected
(control-left button or right button). The particle picking dialog
box has buttons to move forward or backward through the series of
micrographs referenced in the parameter file.</p>
<p>In the case of more than one micrograph per field-of-view, the particles
in only one should be picked. This is typically the further-from-focus
micrograph (usually the second one in each focal pair).</p>
<br />
<h2>3. Finding particle locations in other micrographs in a field-of-view</h2>
<p>Once all the particles have been picked in one micrograph in a
field-of-view, the locations in the other micrographs can be found by aligning
the micrographs to first one. This is most commonly done where the particles
were picked in the further-from-focus micrograph and their locations need to
be transferred to the closer-to-focus micrograph. All of the micrographs can
be aligned using one command line:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bmgalign -v 7 -align mic -ref 2 -resol 2000,30 -correlate 1024,1024,1
-out klh_aln.star klh_*.star &gt; klh_aln.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>To check the alignment, look for the key word &quot;Best fit&quot; in the log
file:</p>
<div id="command"><p>grep Best klh_aln.log</p></div>
<p>The last number on each line gives the RMSD in pixels of the alignment,
where values below 5 pixels represent good fits, below 10 is still
acceptable, but any larger values indicate incorrect alignment. Visual
inspection of the particle coordinates in the closer-to-focus
micrographs should be used to assess the success of alignment.</p>
<p>This alignment is not always successful, and the parameters that can be
adjusted to improve it are the resolution limits (option -resolution)
and the size of the tiles used for correlation (option -correlate,
typically adjust it to larger tile sizes).</p>
<br />
<h2>4. Particle extraction</h2>
<p>Once all the particle coordinates are specified in the parameter files,
the particle images can be extracted (change to the part directory first):</p>
<div id="command"><p>bpick -v 7 -extract 100 -back -norm -partpath ../part -partext pif -out
klh_pick.star ../mg/klh_aln.star</p></div>
<p>The paths in the parameter file are very important for the programs to find the
images. Several of the programs processing parameter files have -*path options
that should be used to set the paths for micrographs, power spectrum images
and particle images. If the images are written in undesirable directories,
this should corrected with the various -*path options.</p>
<br />
<h2>5. CTF correction</h2>
<p>If desired, the extracted particle images can then be corrected for the
CTF (change to the ctf directory first):</p>
<div id="command"><p>bctf -v 3 -data float -back -action flip -resol 2000,10 -partpath
../ctf -out klh_ctf.star ../part/klh_pick.star</p></div>
<p>All the modified particle image files should be written to the ctf
directory.</p>
