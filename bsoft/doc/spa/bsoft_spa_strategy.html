<h1>Single Particle Analysis Strategies</h1>
<p>SPA aims at determining the structure of a particle from electron
micrographs containing many particle images. The modern strategies
for this processing involve the following three issues that need to be
considered before starting processing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Validation</li>
	<li>CTF correction</li>
	<li>Heterogeneity</li>
</ul>
<p>The sections below describe these issues in general with links to
more specific workflows.</p>
<br />
<h2>1. Validation approaches</h2>
<p>The particle images should be processed in such a way that a valid
reconstruction is produced. The principle in all of these approaches
is that the images should contain mutually consistent information.
Pure noise images don't contain such coherent information, but they
can still be aligned to any given reference to give an apparently
reasonable reconstruction. The validation methods below are designed
to avoid mistaking noise images for real particle images, as well
as support the estimated resolution obtained for a reconstruction.</p>
<h3>1.1. <a href="bsoft_spa_simple.html">Resolution-limited alignment</a></h3>
<p>Resolution limits are imposed on the alignment of particles to make use
of that region of the spatial frequencies that carry orientational information.
The low frequencies often have high amplitudes but not much rotational
information, so they should be omitted. The high frequencies often have
very low signal-to-noise, and should be omitted to avoid aligning to noise.
In addition, recovery of information in the reconstruction beyond the
high resolution limit used in alignment provides a measure of validation.
This indicates how resolution limits can be misused. If the user select
too generous high resolution limits, the data can be overfitted (just
another term referring to the inclusion of high frequency noise).
The high resolution limit should therefore be chosen with care.</p>
<h3>1.2. <a href="bsoft_spa_gs.html">Independent data sets ("golden standard")</a></h3>
<p>The notion of independent data sets is simply a variant of repetition in
science. If you get the same result by processing two or more independent
data sets, then the outcome is very likely valid. The way in which this fails
is if common information is used in the processing of the separate data sets.
One example is if the same shape mask is used on the references and possibly
the images. Such data is coerced to converge to the same result. However,
this is rare and should be easily avoided by not sharing any form of
information between data sets.</p>
<h3>1.3. <a href="bsoft_handedness.html">Tilt pair/Handedness analysis</a></h3>
<p>Multiple images of the same particle can be used to verify that the
processing returns the expected corrresponding orientations. This is
typically done by taking tilt pairs of micrographs and comparing the
orientations obtained for the particles. The angle between the
orientations should agree with the angle difference between the micrographs.
This is also one way to determine the handedness of the reconstructions.</p>
<br />
<h2>2. <a href="bsoft_ctf.html">Contrast transfer function correction</a></h2>
<p>The use of underfocused images in cryo-EM to enhance contrast requires a
correction based on the CTF to align the particle images and
recover high frequency information in the reconstructions. The two
approaches are to correct for the CTF in the particle images before alignment
and reconstruction, or to defer the correction to after the alignment and
during reconstruction</p>
<h3>2.1 CTF correction before alignment</h3>
<p>The traditional workflow for SPA involves correcting the extracted
particle images followed by alignment. The images are therefore already corrected
by the time the reconstruction is done. One drawback is that if the correction
is too aggressive in modifying the amplitudes, it may introduce artifacts
that throw off the alignment. In this case it is safest to just do phase
flipping rather than a method that changes the amplitudes</p>
<h3>2.2 CTF correction after alignment</h3>
<p>In a newer workflow, the CTF is applied to the reference projection so that
its power spectrum looks more like that of the original particle image.
Because the application of the CTF is straightforward, any artifacts due to
correction are avoided and the scaling of the amplitudes relative to noise
is similar in both projection and image. The images are then corrected for
the CTF during reconstruction (Note that the same artifacts may be introduced
here if the correction is too aggressive). This is now the preferred
strategy in Bsoft.</p>
<br />
<h2>3. <a href="bsoft_mpa.html">3D Classification</a></h2>
<p>In Bsoft, a form of K-means classification or multi-reference alignment
 is done as follows.
The particles are aligned against multiple reference maps. The particles
are then classified based on their best figure-of-merit with respect
to the reference maps. The process is iterated until a stable set
of maps are generated. The maps/classes can be modified after each
iteration by combining those
maps that are very similar, and generating intermediate maps between
those that are very dissimilar.</p>
