<h1>Single Particle Analysis Preparation</h1>
<p>The advent of direct detectors and automated data acquisition
	means that large amounts of data are acquired in a relatively
	short time. Most of the preprocessing can be done automatically,
	either streaming or as a batch of files. The following
	operations are typically done:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gain correction</li>
	<li>Binning/Size changes</li>
	<li>Frame alignment</li>
	<li>Dose adjustment</li>
	<li>Summation</li>
	<li>Thickness estimation</li>
	<li>CTF determination</li>
</ul>
<p>All except the last can be combined in a single command line.</p>
<br/>
<h2>1 Directory layout and parameter files</h2>
<p>The user must make a decision as to the organization of files.
	The aim is to group files together in directories that have
	some relationship to the stage of processing. This also
	allows the user to try different processing strategies with
	the results deposited in separate directories.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a layout similar to that shown in
	Table 1 be adopted for processing in Bsoft. In the case of
	independent data sets ("golden standard"), the best is to
	split the full data set into two or more major directories
	and process each completely separately.</p>
<p>The parameter files (typically STAR files) embed the image
	paths relative to its location. So it is best not to move
	the parameter files once they have been created. To move
	a parameter file to a different location, copy it by using
	a program such as <b>bmg</b> and write the new file in
	the desired place. The intent is that this will modify the
	image paths so they remain correctly specified in the
	parameter file.</p>

<br />
<p>All programs handling parameter files (such as
	<b>bmg, bpartsel, borient,</b> etc.)
	can read multiple files and concatenate them into one
	large internal parameter database. The whole internal
	database is then written out into one parameter file by
	specifying the &quot;-output&quot; option. If the user
	requires individual parameter files for each micrograph,
	the program <b>bmg</b> has a &quot;-split&quot; option
	to generate one parameter file per micrograph. Some of
	the programs also allow the user to set the path for files,
	which is very important to ensure a smooth and easy workflow.</p>
<p>The concept of a micrograph used in Bsoft is the equivalent
	of taking a single 2D image on a photographic film and
	scanning it in a digitization device. Single images taken
	on CCD or direct cameras qualify as simple micrographs.
	Dose-fractionation (also called movie mode) results
	in a series of 2D images (frames) where the aligned
	average is considered equivalent to a micrograph. The initial
	processing of the micrographs  therefore depends on how they
	were acquired. The best advice is to keep the individual
	micrographs and their derivatives separate and use a script to
	automate all the initial processing up to fitting the CTF
	parameters. Each micrograph is typically preprocessed
	separately and the parameter files combined afterwards.</p>
<br/>
<h2>2. Gain-correction</h2>
<p>In a CCD or direct detector, the gain is typically automatically
	corrected and this step can be skipped. However, sometimes gain
	correction is not done to speed up acquisition. In this case
	gain correction becomes part of the preprocessing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the gain reference image is not guaranteed
	to be oriented in the same way as the micrograph images.
	Every camera has blemishes that show up in both the gain
	reference and micrographs. The orientation is therefore
	determined by comparing the gain reference with a micrograph
	and finding the corresponding blemishes. When each micrograph
	is a set of movie frames, these can be summed to increase
	the signal to be able to see the blemishes:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bimg -verb 7 -sum mg2304.tif mg2304_sum.mrc</p></div>
<p>The gain reference should then be oriented to agree with the
	micrograph:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bimg -verb 7 -reslice x-yz gain.tif gain_resliced.mrc</p></div>
<p>Multiplication of the micrograph with the gain reference should
	now remove the features of the camera chip:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bop -verb 7 -sam 0.537 -mult 1,0 mrc2304_sum.mrc mrc2304_gc.mrc</p></div>
<p>The oriented gain reference is now suitable for use during
	movie frame alignment.</p>
<br/>

<h3>3. Movie frame alignment and summation</h3>
<p>This step is only required where micrographs are acquired
	as movie frames (dose-fractionated). It combines several
	subprocesses in one to speed it up and conserve disk space.</p>
<p>The frames are first aligned progressively, starting from
	a chosen frame, usually not the first frame because of severe
	initial beam-induced movement. The reference is progressively
	averaged from already aligned frames to improve subsequent
	frame alignment. This is then followed by several iterations
	of alignment to the average until the shifts decrease below
	a threshold.</p>
<p>A typical command line is:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bseries -verb 1 -frames -counts -Gainref gain.mrc -dose 0.35 -rate 4 -align 5 -resol 20,1000 -shift 100 -bin 2 -write sum -out mg5523.star mg5523.tif</p></div>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>-frames: Align frames rather than micrographs.</li>
	<li>-counts: Rescale to represent accurate counts of electrons/pixel.</li>
	<li>-Gainreference: Do gain correction with the appropriately oriented gain reference image.</li>
	<li>-dose: The dose per frame in electrons/Ã…2 to do exposure filtering.</li>
	<li>-rate: The frames per second to estimate drift speed.</li>
	<li>-align: Align starting with the indicated reference frame.</li>
	<li>-resolution: Resolution limits for cross-correlation.</li>
	<li>-shift: Limit on translation during cross-correlation.</li>
	<li>-bin: Binning level to decrease image size and increase processing speed.</li>
	<li>-write sum: Write out summed micrographs after alignment.</li>
	<li>-output: Output parameter file.</li>
<ul>
<br />
<h2>4. CTF parameter fitting</h2>
<p>The most efficient way is to run an automated CTF fitting first on
each micrograph, generating an output parameter file for each:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bctf -verb 1 -action prepfit -Range 0.5,3.5 -envtype 4 -frames -tile 512,512,1 -sam 0.537 -resol 5,20 -Volt 300 -Amp 0.07 -Cs 2.7 -out klh_aln_ctf.star klh_aln.star</p></div>
<p>The resultant fits need to be checked and refined in <b>bshow</b>.</p>
<br />
<h2>5. Examining micrographs and CTF fits</h2>
<p>All the output STAR files from the previous steps should be combined
in one large parameter file:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bmg -verb 7 -out klh_all.star *ctf.star</p></div>
<p>The combined parameter file can be opened in <b>bshow</b>:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bshow klh_all.star</p></div>
<p>This will present the user with a list of image files referenced in
the parameter file. At this stage the CTF fits should be examined to make
sure they are the best possible. Therefore, choose a power spectrum from
the list of images (indicated by a "ps" in the file specification).
Then choose the "Micrograph/Fit CTF" option and follow instructions
as described <a href="../bshow/bshow_ctf.html" onclick="return changeIframeContent('ifrm2', this.href)">here</a>.</p>
