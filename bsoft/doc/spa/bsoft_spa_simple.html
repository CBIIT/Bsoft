Note that the following protocol assumes that focal pairs of
micrographs were taken. In the event that only single micrographs were
taken of each field-of-view, the step to align micrographs with
bmgalign can be omitted.<br />
<br />
<h2>1. Preparation</h2>
SPA in Bsoft has been designed to fit nicely into a specific workflow
and a specific directory organization. Within a particular project, a
set of subdirectories at a single level should be created&nbsp; to deal
with the different stages of processing. Table 1 shows&nbsp; the list
of directories typically used.<br />

<br />
<br />
Put all the micrographs in the mg directory.<br />
<br />
All programs handling parameter files (i.e., STAR files) can read
multiple files and concatenate them into one large internal parameter
database. The whole internal database is then written out into one
parameter file by specifying the &quot;-output&quot; option. If the user requires
individual parameter files for each micrograph, the program bmg has a
&quot;-split&quot; option to generate one parameter file per micrograph. Some of
the programs also allow the user to set the path for files, which
becomes very important to ensure a smooth and easy workflow.<br />
<br />

<br />
<h2>2. Options to generate the first parameter files</h2>
<p>The first micrograph parameter files can be generated in various ways
as follows:</p>
<br />
<h3>2.1. Generating parameter files from micrograph images:</h3>
<p>The simplest is to use the micrographs themselves to write new
parameter files:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bmg -v 7 -number 2 -mgpath ../mg -partpath ../part -Pixel 2.2 -Volt 120
-Cs 2 -Amp 0.07 -out klh.star klh_*.mrc</p></div>
<p>
This will generate the first parameter file with the micrographs
arranged as pairs in each field-of-view (option -number) with the
correct pixel size (option -Pixelsize), voltage (option -Volt), Cs
(option Cs), amplitude contribution (option -Amplitude) and the
appropriate paths for the micrographs (option -mgpath) and the particle
images (option -partpath). The parameter file can be split into
multiple files, each referencing just one micrograph:<br />
</p>
<div id="command"><p>bmg -v 7 -split id -out t.star klh.star</p></div>
<br />
Parameter files now have names corresponding to the original input
micrograph files, and each can be opened in <b>bshow</b> to determine the CTF
parameters.<br />
<br />
<h3>2.2. Generating parameter files from bshow:</h3>
The second way is to open each micrograph individually in <b>bshow</b>,
calculate the power spectrum, and fit the CTF parameters. After fitting
the CTF, the parameters are written to a new parameter file.<br />
<br />
<h3>2.3. Automated CTF fitting and generating parameter files:</h3>
The most advanced way is to run an automated CTF fitting first on
each micrograph, generating a parameter file for each. The resultant
fits need to be checked and refined in bshow. The micrographs can be
processed one at a time:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bctf -v 7 -datatype float -action prepfit -sampling 2.2 -out
klh_000239.star klh_000239.mrc klh_000239_ps.map</p></div>
<br />
Alternatively, a script can take care of the whole set (see the script
<a href="../scripts/prepfit.html">prepfit</a>).<br />
<br />
In every case, individual parameter files are generated, one for each
micrograph, in the mg directory. In the last two cases, the paths for
the micrographs and particle images needs to be set in the parameter
files:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bmg -v 7 -number 2 -mgpath ../mg -partpath ../part -Pixel 2.2 -Volt 120
-Cs 2 -Amp 0.07 -out klh.star klh_??????.star</p></div>
<div id="command"><p>bmg -v 7 -split id -out t.star klh.star</p></div>
<br />
<h2>3. CTF fitting in bshow<br />
</h2>
<h3>3.1 Setup</h3>
Depending on the option chosen in the previous section, start in the
following way:<br />
<br />
<h3>3.1.1. Existing parameter file for the micrograph:</h3>
Open the micrograph parameter file in bshow:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bshow klh_000239.star &amp;</p></div>
<br />
Select the micrograph image to open. Then calculate the power spectrum
(see below).<br />
<br />
<h3>3.1.2. Using bshow directly:</h3>
Open the micrograph file in bshow:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bshow klh_000239.mrc &amp;</p></div>
<br />
Then calculate the power spectrum (see below).<br />
<br />
<h3>3.1.3. Existing parameter file and calculated power spectrum:</h3>
The power spectrum is already calculated and an initial fit done.
Open the micrograph parameter file in bshow:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bshow klh_000239.star &amp;</p></div>
<br />
Select the power spectrum to open.<br />
<br />
<h3>3.2. Calculating the power spectrum</h3>
The micrograph image is opened in bshow, and the power spectrum is
calculated (menu item &#8220;Image/Power spectrum&#8221;). The power spectrum can
be calculated in different ways, but for fitting the CTF the best is to
calculate tiles, and to average these to obtain a good estimate of the
power spectrum (don&#8217;t calculate the logarithm of the power spectrum, as
this would not allow an accurate baseline to be fitted). The default
size for the tiles is typically sufficient, although smaller tiles will
give a better estimate of the power spectrum with a decrease in the
sampling of the radial power spectrum. The power spectrum can be saved
for future reference (menu item &quot;File/Save&quot;).<br />
<br />
<h3>3.3. Fitting the CTF</h3>
Once the power spectrum is calculated, the CTF can be fitted in bshow
(menu item &#8220;Micrograph/Fit CTF&#8221;). After setting the accelerating
voltage, Cs (typically 2 mm ) and amplitude contribution (typically 0.2
for negative stain and 0.07 for vitrous ice) to the correct values, the
quick
fit button provides for a fast initial attempt to fit the radial power
spectrum. If it does not give a reasonable initial fit, the user can
manipulate the defocus until the first zero agrees with the first
minimum in the radial power spectrum. The fit can be refined by
successively going through the three buttons for baseline, envelope and
defocus, each controlling only one aspect of the fit at a time. Once a
good fit is obtained, the astigmatism button allows for an estimation
of the astigmatism, only modifying the defocus deviation and
astigmatism angle. The radial power spectrum is adjusted for
astigmatism. At every stage, the user has full control over the fit and
can improve it by hand. The extent to which the fitted CTF curve agrees
with the radial power spectrum, gives the information limit. In other
words, the point at which the last zero agrees with an apparent minimum
in the radial power spectrum, gives the approximate maximum resolution
with significant information above the background noise. This measure
can be used to eliminate bad micrographs from further processing.<br />
<br />
<h2>4. Particle picking<br />
</h2>
<h3>4.1. Picking particles in bshow</h3>
Each further-from-focus micrograph (usually the second one in each
pair) parameter file is opened in bshow (be sure
to open the parameter file and not the micrograph image). To activate
the creation of boxes for picking, click on the boxing tool in the tool
panel (menu item &quot;Window/Tools&quot;). This will bring up a dialog box where
the box radii and bad area radius can be set. A typical particle can be
selected and radii set appropriately (the bad area radius is usually
about half of the box radius). All the particles can be picked (left
button) and deleted (shift-left button), and bad areas selected
(control-left button or right button).<br />
<br />
<h3>4.2. The size of particle images</h3>
One aspect is the size of the particles picked and how efficient a
Fourier transform can be calculated for this size. The program bfft has
an option to test the speed of Fourier transformation for different
image sizes. Picking the size corresponding to the fastest
transformation will decrease the time required for orientation-finding
later on. (Note that simply expanding the image size to a power-of-two
size does not necessarily mean the fastest transformation).<br />
<br />

<br />
<h3>4.3. Finding particle locations in the closer-to-focus micrographs</h3>
Once all the
particles have been picked in the further-from-focus micrographs, the
closer-to-focus micrographs need to be aligned to the
further-from-focus micrographs and the corresponding particle
coordinates transformed:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bmgalign -v 7 -align mic -ref 2 -resol 2000,30 -correlate 1024,1024,1
-out klh_aln.star klh_*.star &gt; klh_aln.log &amp;</p></div>
<br />
To check the alignment, look for the key word &quot;Best fit&quot; in the log
file:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>grep Best klh_aln.log</p></div>
<br />
The last number on each line gives the RMSD in pixels of the alignment,
where values below 5 pixels represent good fits, below 10 is still
acceptable, but any larger values indicate incorrect alignment. Visual
inspection of the particle coordinates in the closer-to-focus
micrographs should be used to assess the success of alignment.<br />
<br />
This alignment is not always successful, and the parameters that can be
adjusted to improve it are the resolution limits (option -resolution)
and the size of the tiles used for correlation (option -correlate,
typically adjust it to larger tile sizes).<br />
<br />
<h3>4.4. Particle extraction</h3>
Once all the particle coordinates are specified in the parameter files,
the
particle images can be extracted (change to the part directory first):<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpick -v 7 -extract 100 -back -norm -partpath ../part -partext pif -out
klh_pick.star ../mg/klh_aln.star</p></div>
<br />
All the particle image files should be written to the part directory.<br />
<br />
<h2>5. CTF correction</h2>
<br />
The extracted particle images can then be corrected in some way for the
CTF (change to the ctf directory first):<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bctf -v 3 -data float -back -action flip -resol 2000,10 -partpath
../ctf -out klh_ctf.star ../part/klh_pick.star</p></div>
<br />
All the modified particle image files should be written to the ctf
directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>6. Determining particle orientations</h2>
<p>A reference map consistent with the size of the particle images is required. This map can be from a previous reconstruction of the same type of particles, a map generated from an atomic structure, or a synthetic map generated from geometric shapes (see the <a href="../general/bsoft_synmap.html">Synthetic Map</a> part for more information).</p>
There are two programs for particle alignment: borient and brefine. borient
does a global search of orientations in the asymmetric unit while brefine
improves the already existing orientations locally.
  <br />
  <h3>a. borient:</h3>
  <p>For each run of orientation-finding, create one directory such as run1,
  run2, etc. Change to the next run directory and launch borient to
  determine particle orientations:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>borient -v 1 -sym D5 -angle 2 -resol 25,150 -ann 10,90 -mode ccc -ref
  klh_ref.pif -out klh_run1.star ../klh_ctf.star &gt; klh_run1.log &amp;</p></div>
  <p>Depending on the particle size and the search grid (determined by the option -angles), this
  can run for a long time (smaller angles mean more projections and
  longer runtimes).</p>
  <p>The algorithm in borient determines the orientations of the particles
  using a reference-based projection-matching algorithm. Projection
  images are produced from a reference map for all views within the
  asymmetric unit for the specified point group. For every comparison of
  a particle image to a projection image, the best matching in-plane
  rotation angle and the best particle origin are determined. The
  in-plane rotation matching is done by using polar images of both the
  projection and the particle. Because this is dependent on the origin if
  done in real space, the first determination of the in-plane rotation
  angle is done on polar power spectra of the projection and the
  particle. The projection is rotated by the in-plane rotation angle and
  cross-correlated with the particle to find the first estimate of the
  origin. This provides a reasonable origin for generating the polar
  image of the particle, which is then used to find the next estimate of
  the in-plane rotation angle. The origin and angle determinations are
  done iteratively until the result stabilizes (typically only 2-4
  iterations). The projection image giving the best correlation
  coefficient for a specific particle image determines the view
  parameters for that particle. The key parameters are the angular
  increments between views (option -angles; typically 0.5 &#8211; 3&#730;), the
  annuli used for the real space polar image matching (option -annuli;
  usually include the whole particle image) and the resolution limits for
  reciprocal space polar image matching and cross-correlation (option
  -resolution). A particular range of annuli can be specified for
  determining the in-plane rotation angle, allowing exclusion of
  especially the center of the particle which may not contribute to an
  accurate determination of this angle.</p>
  <p>The output from orientation-finding is a new parameter file with the
  following new parameters for the best fit of the particle images to the
  projection images:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Particle origins</li>
  <li>Particle views</li>
  <li>FOMs: Figures-of-merit based on the correlation coefficient for
the bets fit</li>
  <li>Projection index for the best fit: this appears in the selection
column <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The orientation-finding should only be run once per reference map,
because the existing parameters in the input parameter files are not
used in subsequent runs. (The reason is that iterative refinement has
already been incorporated in borient and multiple runs on the same
reference map will just give the same results.)</p>
<h3>b. brefine</h3>
<p>After a previous run to find the rough particle orientations in the
asymmetric unit, brefine can be used to improve the orientations locally.
It is run the same way as borient, typically in a new directory:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>brefine -v 1 -grid 2,0.2 -res 20 -mag 0.03 -kernel 6,2 -ref
  ../run1/klh_run1.pif -out klh_run2.star ../run1/klh_run1.star &gt; klh_run2.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>The refinement algorithm runs in reciprocal space, extracting a central section
from the Fourier transform of the reference map with kernel-based interpolation.
The central section is then compared with the particle transform and a figure-of-measure (FOM)
calculated (-fomtype option) to the specified resolution (-resolution option).
This comparison is repeated in a small grid around the current view,
starting at an initial stepsize and contracting around the best solution
to a minimum step size (the step sizes are the two values for option -grid).
Refinement of the magnification can also be turned on, specifying the maximum
adjustment in magnification to consider (-magnification option).</p>
<p>brefine can be run in a different mode:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>brefine -v 1 -monte 10 -res 25 -kernel 8,2 -ref
  ../run1/klh_run1.pif -out klh_run2.star ../run1/klh_run1.star &gt; klh_run2.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>Here the orientation parameters are adjusted using a Monte Carlo approach to
find views close to the input that improve the FOM's. The more iterations are run
(value for the -monte option) the more likely that good solutions will be found,
but at the cost of longer runs. The extent of changes in this algorithm can
controlled through the options -shift, -view and -angle.</p>
<br />
<h2>7. Particle selection</h2>
<p>The selection of particles for reconstruction can be done in several
ways.</p>
a. Particles can be selected by the correlation coefficients (FOMs)
generated during
orientation-finding:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -fom 0.34 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
b. The FOMs are typically related to the defocus, and this can be used
to select particles with a varying FOM cutoff based on a linear fit
between the FOM and defocus values. This is turned on by adding a flag
to the &quot;-fom&quot; option:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -fom 0.2,1 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
c. A given percentage of the particles ranked by FOMs can be selected:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -top 70 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
d. The FOM cutoff for selection can be based on the standard deviation
of the FOMs:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -deviation -1.5 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
e. The FOMs can be ranked and grouped into sets of decreasing FOMs to
be able to generate several reconstructions:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -rank 5 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
There are several other particle selection schemes that can also be
used.<br />
<br />
<h2>8. Reconstruction</h2>
The reconstruction can then be done from the selected particles.
Typically, two maps from different halves of the selected particles
need to be generated to determine resolution. These two maps can be added
afterwards to give the full map. The program breconstruct has several options
to do the reconstruction in different ways, depending on the desired outcome
as well as the capabilities of the computer being used. Here are a few cases:</p>
<h3>a. A simple reconstruction:</h3>
<p>The main decision is to what resolution the reconstruction should be calculated:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<h3>b. Two half set reconstructions and a full set reconstruction:</h3>
<p>All three maps can be calculated at the same time:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>The resultant maps from the half sets have the inserts &quot;_01&quot; and &quot;_02&quot; before
the extension. These maps can be added to generate a single reconstruction
that is the same as the full set map:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bop -v 7 -add 1,0 klh_run1_01.pif klh_run1_02.pif klh_run1.pif</p></div>
<h3>c. Threaded reconstruction:</h3>
<p>If Bsoft was compiled with OpenMP and FFTW3 support, the reconstruction can be run with multiple threads:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -threads 8 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>Be aware that this is very memory-intensive, requiring 20 times the map volume per thread.
For example, a map of size 500^3 will require about 2.5 Gb per thread.</p>
<h3>d. Selected reconstructions:</h3>
<p>Reconstructions can also be done from specific selection numbers in
the parameter file using the &quot;-classes&quot; option:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -classes 1,3-5 -threads 2 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>In this case the threads are per class, and for calculating halfmaps in each class, the number of threads should be even.
Because of memory limitations, it is likely better to specify only one class per run.</p>
<br />
<h2>9. Resolution determination</h2>
The two reconstructions are then compared to determine the resolution:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bresolve -v 7 -resol 15 -Post klh_run1_resol.ps -map klh_run1_01.pif
klh_run1_02.pif</p></div>
<br />
The resolution curves for FSC (Fourier shell correlation) and DPR
(differential phase residual) are written into the postscript file in
such a way that it can be opened in a graphing program that can
interpret text files (Kaleidagraph or Excel).<br />
