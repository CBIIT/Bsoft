    <h1>Binary distributions</h1>
	
	<p>Selected binary distributions are provided to simplify installation of
		the more complicated parts of Bsoft. In particular, the FFTW3 library
		and threading (OpenMP or Grand Central Dispatch) support are included
		in the distributions.
		In most cases Bsoft was compiled against Tcl/Tk 8.5.</p>
	<p>These distributions will unpack in a directory called "bsoft" (no need to compile).
		To complete the installation, make sure the environmental variables
		are set correctly to point to the Bsoft programs and library.</p>
	<p>See below for the source code that can be compiled on any Unix flavor.</p>

	<h3>Old versions</h3>
	<p><a href="old">Old versions</a> of Bsoft are provided for those who developed code based on those. 
	<br/>
	<h3>New versions</h3>
    <p>Newer versions than the current major release can be found <a href="new">here</a>.
	These distributions are not necessarily complete and need to be 
	unpacked within an existing bsoft directory.</p>
	<br/>
    <h2>Platforms supported</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Linux (i386/i686, x86_64, PowerPC, Alpha, Itanium)</li>
      <li>Darwin or MacOSX (PowerPC, Intel)</li>
      <li>IRIX64 (SGI)</li>
      <li>Solaris (Sun)</li>
      <li>AIX (IBM)</li>
      <li>OSF1 or Tru64 (Alpha)</li>
      <li>VMS (Alpha)</li>
      <li>Cygwin_NT (Windows NT)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In principle the package could be compiled on any Unix-based operating system.</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Mac OS X:</h3>
    <p>The default installations of Mac OS X don't have the compilers installed.
	Download Xcode from the Apple developer's web site and install it first:</p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode</a>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the Mac OS X Xcode versions should be matched with the different operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger): Xcode 2.5</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard): Xcode 3</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard): Xcode 3</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion): Xcode 4</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion): Xcode 4</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks): Xcode 5</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite): Xcode 6</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan): Xcode 7</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.12 (Sierra): Xcode 8</li>
      <li>Mac OS X 10.13 (High Sierra): Xcode 10</li>
   </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>The Z library:</h3>
    <p>The inclusion of the PNG format in Bsoft requires libz for compression.
	The required files are:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>/usr/include/zlib.h or /usr/local/include/zlib.h</li>
      	<li>/usr/lib/libz.* (such as libz.a or libz.so)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On some versions of Unix and VMS, libz may not be available, therefore 
	it is included in the distribution and will be compiled.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Tcl/Tk:</h3>
    <p>Bsoft is primarily a command-line package, with all the necessary code 
	included in the package. However, from version 0.9, it includes a Tcl/Tk 
	interface and a Tcl/Tk script, <strong>bshow</strong>, useful for the 
	display of images and a few interactive manipulations (not available for VMS). 
	The Tcl/Tk version must be 8.3 or higher. Bsoft can be compiled without 
	Tcl/Tk (see below for details).</p>
  <p>On most Unix boxes, the Tcl/Tk headers and libraries are installed in either
  /usr or /usr/local (look for /usr/include/tk.h or /usr/local/include/tk.h). 
  Linux distributions typically have separate packages for the runtime and 
  developer versions of Tcl/Tk. Both need to be installed to be able to use 
  <strong>bshow</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Bsoft configuration script, bconf, tries to find the Tcl/Tk headers 
	automatically. Make sure the Tcl/Tk version is 8.3 or higher. Make sure the commands &quot;tcl&quot; and &quot;wish&quot; are in your executable path.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>XML:</h3>
    <p>The default format for  parameter files is the STAR format. These can 
	also be written in an XML format, but requires the <strong>libxml2</strong> 
	library with its header files. The common locations for the header files 
	are in /usr/include/libxml2 and the library in /usr/lib. The source code
	for this library is not included in Bsoft due to its sheer size.</p>
	<br/>
    <h2>Enhancements</h2>
    <p>These enhancements are optional and may be included during compilation.</p>
    <h3>OpenMP:</h3>
    <p>Several operations in Bsoft have been parallelized with OpenMP. Support 
	for OpenMP has been part of gcc since version 4.2, and platforms such as 
	Mac OS X (before 10.7) and Linux support it.</p>
    <h3>Grand Central Dispatch:</h3>
    <p>On mac OS X 10.7 and later, the compiler has been changed to clang which
	does not support OpenMP. In stead, threading is done using Grand Central Dispatch.</p>
    <h3>FFTW3:</h3>
    <p>Because of the complexities in the new versions of FFTW (3.x), it is no 
	longer included with the Bsoft distribution. It should be compiled as 
	single-precision floating point with support for OpenMP turned on if 
	parallel operations are also desired.</p>
