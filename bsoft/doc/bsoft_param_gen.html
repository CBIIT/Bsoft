<h2>The Parametric Data Base</h2>

<p>Image and molecular processing requires and produces large amounts
    of informational and parametric data. The traditional way to deal with
    this in software packages is to define one or more package-specific
    parameter file formats. Often, these formats have a strict notion of the
    placement and order of informational elements, making it hard to
    impossible to ensure backward compatibility as these formats evolve. The
    alternative to such formats is a flexible, tag-based format that is easy
    to maintain and extend. For Bsoft, I adopted the STAR (Self-defining Text
    Archiving and Retrieval) format (Hall, 1991). An alternative is XML,
    although as text files, XML files are less readable and takes much more
    space compared to the equivalent STAR files.</p>
<h2>Internal hierarchies of structures</h2>
<p>Bsoft was and is developed within the context of Structural Biology,
and in particular associated with the use of high-resolution electron microscopy. 
The types of data can therefore be grouped into the image processing side, 
including sets of micrographs taken on electron microscopes and 
3D reconstructions derived from them, and the modeling side, 
including atoms, molecules and molecule groups that can be arranged in
lower resolution component-based models.</p>
<h3>Micrograph parameters</h3>
<p>The parameters derived and generated in the processing of many micrographs
and their associated sub-images are encoded in an internal hierarchy as a
custom database. The two main branches of the design hierachy are the
field-of-view and the reconstruction. The former refers to sets of micrographs
grouped in terms of their natural relationships to each other. Fields-of-view
may refer to focal pairs/series, tomographic tilt series, dose series (movies), etc.
The reconstruction branch is intended to reference 3D maps as from single particle
or tomographic reconstructions.</p>
<p>Below the micrograph and reconstruction levels of the hierarchy are derived
elements, such as particle, filament and marker parameters. The hierarchy preserves
the relational infomartion so that the providence of derived elements are always
retrievable.</p>
<h3>Model and molecular parameters</h3>
<p>The ultimate goal in Structural Biology is the production of a spatial
model as an interpretation of the data. Bsoft provides for a hierarchical
modeling scheme, with atomic models being the highest detail models, followed
by succesively coarser grained models.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Additional parameter files</h2>
<p>There are several sets of general parametric data required for
      various operations on atomic coordinates and sequences. These files are
      all located in the bsoft/parameters directory.</p>
<h3>atom_prop.star</h3>
<p>This file contains atomic properties such as the atomic number,
        the atomic weights (Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 73, No. 4, pp. 667-683,
        2001.) and the electron scattering coefficients required to calculate
        atomic cross-sections for electron microscopy (Peng et al., Acta
        Cryst. (1996). A52, 257-276). Any program reading atomic coordinates
        requires this file to retrieve at least the atomic weights. The
        program "bsf" uses the scattering curves to calculate the Fourier
        space representation of atomic structures.</p>
<h3>res_prop.star</h3>
<p>This file contains protein residue properties such as mass,
        volume, charge, and hydrophobicity. In addition, it has a residue
        similarity matrix based on the BLOSUM62 matrix. Most of the sequence
        analyses requires information from this file.</p>
<h3>symop.star</h3>
<p>This file encodes all the symmetry information for the
        crystallographic space groups. This was derived from the symop.lib
        file from the CCP4 software suite.</p>
<h3>.krn files</h3>
<p>These files specify kernels for convolution filters used by the
        program bfilter. The first line of the file gives the dimensions of
        the kernel. The subsequent lines give all the values of the kernel in
        order, with the arrangements per line being arbitrary. Here is a
        typical kernel for a Sobel filter in the y direction, called
        SobelY.krn:</p>
	<blockquote><p>3 3 3</p>
	<p>1 3 1</p>
	<p>0 0 0</p>
	<p>-1 -3 -1</p>
	<p>3 6 3</p>
	<p>0 0 0</p>
	<p>-3 -6 -3</p>
	<p>1 3 1</p>
	<p>0 0 0</p>
	<p>-1 -3 -1</p>
