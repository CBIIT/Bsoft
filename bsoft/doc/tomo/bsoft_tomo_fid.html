<h1>Tomographic series fiducial-based alignment</h1>
<p>The fiducial-based alignment algorithm attempts to predict where a fiducial
	marker image moves with a change in tilt angle. Because the major
	movement is perpendicular to the tilt axis, the tilt axis angle must
	be known to a reasonable degree of accuracy. The following workflow
	starts with defining a marker seed set in the zero-degree (or close to it)
	micrograph. The tilt axis is then determined, followed by marker
	tracking and refinement. The final product is a full 3D transform 
	for every micrograph to place it within the same frame of reference.</p>
<p>All of this can be done automatically on the command line. However,
	the user must use some judgment in choosing the parameters for each
	alignment. These include the parameter sfor generating the power
	spectra and fitting the CTF. Sometimes the marker tracking
	fails for some micrographs, which then need to be corrected manually.</p>
	<br />
<h2>1. Generating seed fiducial markers</h2>
<p>Open the parameter file in bshow and change to the zero-degree tilt
	micrograph. Make sure the marker radius is accurately set to half
	the diameter of a typical marker image. Select the menu item 
	&#8220;Tomography/Find markers in current image&#8221;. 
	This will cross-correlate a synthetic marker based on the marker 
	radius with the image, and present a set of hits and a dialog box. 
	Adjust the FOM slider in the dialog box until a satisfactory set 
	of markers are selected and click on &quot;Done&quot;.</p>

	style="width: 500px;" alt="Seed markers and FOM slider window"

	</center>

<p>Markers can be added or deleted manually with the marker tool:</p>
	 <img id="inline" title="Marker" src="../bshow/marker_active.gif" alt="Marker" width="36" height="36" />
<p>Eliminate markers that are close to edges, because they
	might not stay within the frames of all the images in the series.
	Markers that are clustered should all be selected because the
	algorithm relies on cross-correlating the vicinity of every marker,
	not just the marker.
	Save the result to a parameter file using the menu item
	&quot;Micrograph/Write parameters&quot;.<br />
<br />
<h2>2. Finding the tilt axis</h2>
<p>The tilt axis angle is determined by how the camera is installed,
	as well as the magnification used. In modern electron microscopes
	the magnifications are chosen to avoid big rotations when changing
	magnification. Once the tilt axis angle is known for a particular
	microscope and magnification, it can be used as starting point for
	alignment. In Bsoft, the tilt axis angle is defined
  	as the counterclockwise rotation angle from the x-axis to the tilt
  	axis. To find the tilt axis angle to within acceptable accuracy, 
  	two methods are available. The first is a fast method potentially with
  	less accuracy, and the second is slower and more accurate.
  	Eventually, after proper tracking of the markers, the refinement
  	of the micrograph orientations will give the best possible tilt
  	axis angle. This axis angle can then be used for all subsequent
  	tilt series obtained from the same microscope.</p>
<p>Note that the nominal tilt angles must already be specified.</p>
<br/>
<h3>2.1. Fast tilt axis determination</h3>
<p>The program <b>btrack</b> offers a fast way to determine
	the tilt axis. The algorithm uses two micrographs closest to the
	positive and negative of the tilt angle specified. At each axis angle
	within the range specified, the seed markers are used to generate
	an image that has the distribution of markers expected. This is then
	correlated with the corresponding micrograph. The axis angle that
	gives the maximum correlation is taken as the correct one.</p>
<p>The following command line selects micrographs close to 15° tilt
	and with a tilt axis angle step size of 1° witin the range of
	-10° to 10°:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btrack -v 1 -findaxis 15,1,-10,10 -out gold3_findaxis.star gold3.star</p></div>
<p>The same command can be launched from within <b>bshow</b>
	using the "Workflow/Find tilt axis" menu item.<p>
<center><img
style="width: 500px;" alt="Find tilt axis dialog window"
src="tomo_findaxis.png" /><br />
</center>
<p>The output is written to a text window that can be saved using the
	"File" menu.</p>
	<center><img
	style="width: 500px;" alt="Find tilt axis results window"
	src="tomo_findaxis_result.png" /><br />
	</center>

<p>At this stage the results are not yet in
	<b>bshow</b> memory. Close the text window and click
	on the "Load" button in the "FindAxis" window to load the new
	parameter file in memory. The best tilt axis angle should now
	be displayed in the "Tomography" window.</p>
  <br />

<h3>2.2. The tomax script</h3>
<p>This script uses full tracking runs with different tilt axis
	angles to determine the best residual. It is very
	compute-intensive and should only be used if the faster
	method doesn't work. The <a href="../scripts/tomax.html">tomax</a>
	script is run specifying the initial angle, the angle step size,
	and the final angle to test for:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>tomax -angles -10,1,10 gold3_seed.star</p></div>
  <p>or:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>tomax.pl --file gold3.star --start -10 --end 10</p></div>
  <p>The output gives the residual for a single iteration attempt of
  tracking the markers at each tilt axis angle. The best (lowest)
  residual is reported and should be used subsequently.</p>

<h2>3. Alignment: Tracking markers</h2>
<p>The program <b>btrack</b> tracks the markers
	starting at the micrograph with the seed fiducial
	markers, usually one close to zero-degree tilt. The tracking proceeds
	from low to high tilt angles in both directions. For each micrograph,
	it generates an image containing all the markers at their current
	locations and considering the current tilt angle. This is then
	correlated with the micrograph to get the shift (which defines the
	micrograph origin). The z-coordinate of each marker is then determined by
	tracking along a line perpendicular to the tilt axis, cross-correlating
	with a marker reference image. This generates a z-coordinate for
	the marker for every micrograph in the tilt series. The actual
	z-coordinate is taken as the average of all the z-coordinates.
	The standard deviation of the z-coordinates is used as an
	indication of how well the marker location is defined.
	This process is iterated (typically 2-5 times) until the average
	change in z-coordinates drop below a set stopping condition
	(usually one pixel) or up to the maximum number of iterations.
	The combination of translations and rotations have an infinite
	number of representations. To restrict them to the most useful
	representations, the overall z-coordinates should be recentered
	after processing each micrograph. This keeps the micrographs
	within the same volume that will eventually become that of
	the reconstructed tomogram. Finally, the exact positions
	of the markers in each micrograph are then refined (-refine markers).</p>
<p>The tracking can be done from the command line or from
	<b>bshow</b> (see below).
	A typical command line is:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>btrack -v 1 -exclude none -reset -update -track 1,1.5 -axis -5 -resol 20,1000 -recenter -refine markers -out gold3_trk.star gold3_seed.star &gt;&amp; gold3_trk.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>The options used here are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The -exclude none option ensures that all the micrographs are selected.</li>
	<li>The -resetmodel option ensures that the zero-tilt marker positions agree with those of the 3D model at the start of tracking.</li>
	<li>The -updatematrix option recalculates the micrograph orientation matrices from the tilt axis and tilt angles.</li>
	<li>The -track option activates tracking and sets the maximum number of iterations and the target stopping condition.</li>
	<li>The -axis option sets the tilt axis angle</li>
	<li>The -resolution option limits cross-correlation. For high-intensity gold markers the relatively low resolution limit of 20 Å should suffice in most cases.</li>
	<li>The -recenter option centers the overal z-coordinates at every update.</li>
	<li>The -refine markers option adjusts the final locations of the markers by cross-correlation with a marker reference image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equivalent in <b>bshow</b> is done by selecting the
	"Workflow/Track markers" menu item:</p>
<center><img
style="width: 500px;" alt="Track dialog window"
src="tomo_track_dialog.png" /><br />
</center>

<p>After every iteration a parameter file is written to allow for user
  inspection and trouble-shooting (file names gold3_trk_01.star,
  gold3_trk_02.star, ... ).
  To follow the progress in tracking, the log file can be queried:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>grep Cycle gold3_trk.log</p></div>
  <p>Cycle 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average change in
  positions = 35.8846</p>
  <p>Cycle 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Average change in
  positions = 0.440963</p>
  <p>This gives the change in marker positions for every iteration,
  with the first always a high number because the z-coordinates are
  zero at the start. When the change in positions drop below the
  stopping condition, a reasonable
  alignment has been reached and the program finishes.
  Otherwise, the iterations continue up to the maximum specified.
  The overall residual is given at the end of the log file:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>tail -2 gold3_trk.log</p></div>
  <p>Average residual = 1.98881 pixels</p>
  <p>The new parameter file can be read with <b>bshow</b>
   to examine the marker positions:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>bshow gold3_trk.star &amp;</p></div>
  <p>If the tracking is done from <b>bshow</b>, the output
  parameter file can be loaded with the "Load" button in the tracking
  dialog window (see above).</p>
<h2>4. Alignment: Fixing markers and refinement</h2>
<p>The success of tracking varies because of intrinsic features in
	each tilt series. In the majority of cases the marker locations
	need to be adjusted manually to improve the alignment. In the
	<b>bshow</b> image display, the markers have
	orange lines, where each line indicates
	the difference between the current marker position and the position
	predicted from the 3D marker model. Markers with big deviations or
	those that are obviously incorrect, can be adjusted manually.
	For manual positioning, drag the marker until it fits nicely over
	the correct marker image. In some cases, the whole set of markers
	are offset. This can be fixed with the grouping tool:</p>
	<img id="inline" title="Marker" src="../bshow/marker_group_active.gif"
	alt="Marker group" width="36" height="36" />
	<p>Place the cursor on one marker and drag the whole set to coincide
	with correct marker images. To turn off the grouping behavior,
	select the pointer tool:</p>
	<img id="inline" title="Marker" src="../bshow/point_active.gif"
	   alt="Marker group" width="36" height="36" />
<p>Select the "Tomography/Refine" alignment. This opens a dialog box
	with several options to improve the alignment:</p>
	<center><img
	style="width: 300px;" alt="Refinement dialog window"
	src="tomo_refine_dialog.png" /><br />
	</center>
<ul>
  <li>Markers, which refines the marker positions on the micrographs</li>
  <li>Z-coordinates, which refines the 3D model z-coordinates</li>
  <li>Micrographs, which refines the geometry associated with each
micrograph</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Views</li>
    <li>Origins</li>
    <li>Scales (be careful here, scale refinement may compensate for
tilts and should only be done once and as the last refinement)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
<p>The top option is to refine the marker positions by cross-correlation.
	This is the same as the -refine markers option in btrack. Run this option
	once by clicking on the "Do" button. This will change the "Residual"
	value in the main "Tomography" window. This is typically be in the range
	of 1-20 pixels before any further refinement.</p>
	<p>Next, select the "Z-coordinates" checkbutton and run it. Then
	select the "Micrographs" checkbutton, as well as the "Views" and
	"Origins", and run it. Both these should reduce the residuals.
	Run these two options alternately until the residual stay about
	the same.</p>
<p> The menu item &quot;Tomography/Show marker table&quot; and the
	"Marker table" button in the main Tomography window opens a table
	of markers. This table lists the markers with their associated
	FOM's and residuals. The buttons at the bottom allow the user
	to find the highest and lowest of each parameter, and step
	through the markers. The display in the main window will change
	to show the selected marker. Select the markers with high residuals
	and manually adjust them to positions that are correct by eye.
	Then click on the "Update" button to recalculate the overall residual
	displayed in the main Tomography window. Combine this with
	refining the Z-coordinates and micrograph orientations in
	the "Refine" window.</p>
<p>The refinement can also be run on the command line:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btrack -v 1 -reset -refine 10,z,o,v -out gold3_ref.star gold3_trk.star &gt;&amp; gold3_ref.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>Once the overall residual is acceptably low (typically 1-3 pixels)
	and all markers are deemed to be in the correct locations,
	save the parameter file. The micrograph orientations are now
	appropriately specified for reconstruction. The algorithms in Bsoft
	are based on a general rigid-body target function with no restrictions
	on the view (such as assuming a tilt axis perpendicular to the
	electron beam), so that the final alignment can be used directly
	in reconstruction.</p>
<br/>
<h2><a name="troubleshooting" id="troubleshooting"></a>5. Trouble shooting</h2>
<h3>5.1. Marker reference images</h3>
<p>If the overall residual remains high (&gt; 5 pixels), there may a
	problem with how the alignemnet is done. The marker tracking and
	location refinement rely on a marker reference images produced as
	an average of the marker images in the zero-tilt micrograph.
	These images are written into the files &quot;marker_track_ref.map&quot;
	and &quot;marker_refine_ref.map&quot; for tracking and refinement,
	respectively. They should look something like this: </p>
<center><img src="marker_track_ref.png" alt="Tracking reference marker" width="100" height="100" /><br />
</center>
<p>If they look significantly different from the example, please send me a bug report with all the details (<a href="mailto:bernard_heymann@nih.gov">bernard_heymann@nih.gov</a>).</p>
<br/>
<h3>5.2. Manual marker positioning</h3>
<p>If marker tracking completely fails, the markers can be manually
	positioned. To alleviate some of the manual labor required, markers
	can be generated from a seed in the zero-tilt micrograph, using the
	nominal tilt axis and tilt angles:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btrack -v 1 -generate -out gold3_gen.star gold3_seed.star</p></div>
<p>This can also be done in <b>bshow</b> using the menu item &quot;Tomography/Generate markers from seed&quot;. The markers can then
	be correctly placed manually, poentially followed by the refinement
	steps aoutlined above.</p>
