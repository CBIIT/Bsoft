<h2>The STAR format</h2>
<p>The STAR format is a plain text format (i.e., human-readable) that
      defines tag-value pairs with few rules on the composition of the
      file:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><p>The file name must end in one of the extensions: ".star" or
          ".cif" (case insensitive) (CIF: Crystallographic Information
          File)</p></li>
<li><p>Each file must have one or more data blocks. The start of a
          data block is defined by the keyword "data_"followed by an optional
          string for identification (e.g., "data_micrograph_145"). For image
          processing, each set of parameters for a micrograph is mapped to a
          data block. Precede the keyword by an empty line to avoid problems
          in parsing.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple values associated with one or more tags in a data
          block can be arranged in a table using the keyword "loop_" followed
          by the list of tags and columns of values. The values are delimited
          by whitespace (i.e., blanks, tabs, end-of-lines and carriage
          returns). The loop must be followed by an empty line to indicate its
          end.</p></li>
<li><p>Tag names always starts with an underscore ("_"). Each tag
          name may only be used once within each data block.</p></li>
<li><p>Data items or values can be numeric or strings of characters.
          A string is interpreted as a single item when it doesn't contain
          spaces or when it follows a tag not in a loop, or when it is
          enclosed in quotes (single or double), or when it is enclosed
          between lines with the first character a semicolon in each line. In
          Bsoft, all values are read as strings. Conversions to numeric values
          have to be made from the specific program accessing the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments are strings which can occur in three places:</p>
	<ul type="circle"><li><p>File comments: All text before the first "data_"
              keyword</p></li>
	<li><p>Data block comments: Strings on their own lines starting
              with "#" or with ";" as the first character in the line. The ";"
              character is used for multiple lines and must be followed by a
              closing ";" as the first character of a new line.</p></li>
	<li><p>Item comments: Strings on the same line as and following
              tag-value items, also indicated by a leading "#".</p></li>
	</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Hint: Make ample use of empty lines to delimit different parts of
      a parameter file.</p>
<p>Many Bsoft programs add processing information to initial comments
      in a file, to allow the user to track the history of the file.</p>
