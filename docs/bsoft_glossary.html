<dt>bitmap</dt><dd><p>an image consisting of a binary data type, i.e., each voxel has
        one of only two possible values.</p></dd>
<dt>CMYK</dt><dd><p>Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-blacK four-colour scale for printers.</p></dd>
<dt>color model</dt><dd><p>the way in which colors are represented within a data structure.
        Typical color models are gray scale, bitmap, RGB and CMYK.</p></dd>
<dt>complex data type</dt><dd><p>a data type composed of a real number and an imaginary
        number.</p></dd>
<dt>contrast transfer function</dt><dd><p>in the context of an electron microscope, the transfer function
        introduced by objective projection lenses manifested as phase shifts
        in images and limiting resolution.</p></dd>
<dt>data type</dt><dd><p>the size and type of each element of an image data block.
        Typical data types are byte, short, integer, float, and
        complex_float.</p></dd>
<dt>image</dt><dd><p>a 1D, 2D, or 3D data set of elements, each element composed of
        one or more values. An image may also refer to a series of 1D, 2D, or
        3D data sets arranged in some logical order (such as particle images
        from a micrograph, a tilt series of micrographs, or a time
        series).</p></dd>
<dt>map</dt><dd><p>synonym for image, most often used for a 3D reconstruction made
        from 2D images.</p></dd>
<dt>montage</dt><dd><p>a way to package 2D images or 2D slices from a 3D image into a
        large 2D matrix mainly for display purposes.</p></dd>
<dt>origin</dt><dd><p>the origin of an image is defined by the intersection of the
        symmetry axes of a symmetric object it contains, or by the rotation
        origin for operations to transform it.</p></dd>
<dt>periodogram</dt><dd><p>the intensity map of a Fourier transform used as an estimator of
        the power spectrum. A better power spectrum estimator is obtained from
        averaging multiple periodograms from different samples of the same
        signal.</p></dd>
<dt>pixel</dt><dd><p>a single raster element in a 2D image (see voxel).</p></dd><dt>pixel size</dt><dd><p>the sampling interval or pixel/voxel size on a regular grid in
        each dimension. (see sampling)</p></dd>
<dt>polar data type</dt><dd><p>a data type composed of an amplitude and a phase. Typically used
        for Fourier transforms. power spectrum - </p></dd>
<dt>power spectrum</dt><dd><p>the power in a signal (intensity or squared amplitude) as a
        function of spectral frequency (also called the spectral density),
        typically estimated by calculating periodograms.</p></dd>
<dt>projection</dt><dd><p>average of density along the line of sight and represented by a
        view vector and rotation angle around that vector (see view).</p></dd>
<dt>quaternion</dt><dd><p>also called a hypercomplex number, it is composed of one real
        value and three imaginary values. Quaternions are compact descriptions
        of rotations in 3D space, requiring fewer elements and constraints
        than rotation matrices.</p></dd>
<dt>reslicing</dt><dd><p>the storage order of a map is reorganized, so that axes are
        switched and/or mirrored. This is equivalent to single or multiple 90
        degree rotations, with or without mirroring.</p></dd>
<dt>RGB</dt><dd><p>Red-Green-Blue three-colour scale for monitor displays.</p></dd><dt>sampling</dt><dd><p>the sampling interval or pixel/voxel size on a regular grid in
        each dimension. (see pixel size)</p></dd>
<dt>Single particle analysis/processing</dt><dd><p>Acquiring images of different single particles presumed to be
        identical copies of each other, and finding the relative orientations
        of these 2D images to allow merging into a 3D reconstruction.</p></dd>
<dt>SPA</dt><dd><p>See Single particle analysis/processing.</p></dd>
<dt>SPP</dt><dd><p>See Single particle analysis/processing.</p></dd>
<dt>STAR</dt><dd><p>Self-defining Text Archiving and Retrieval.</p></dd><dt>tomography</dt><dd><p>acquiring images of a single object from a series of different
        views, aligning these images with respect to each other, and
        generating a 3D reconstruction.</p></dd>
<dt>view</dt><dd><p>orientation of a viewer described by a vector along the line of
        sight and a rotation angle around that vector (an alternative to using
        Euler angles).</p></dd>
<dt>voxel</dt><dd><p>a single raster element in a 3D image (see pixel).</p></dd><dt>wrapping</dt><dd><p>view the image or map as having periodic boundaries, so that
        enlargement of the image (without scaling!) would produce repeated
        copies of the image or map.</p></dd>
