<h2>The micrograph parameter hierarchy</h2>
<p>The unit data element originating from an electron microscope is a
      micrograph. Typically, a collection of micrographs are taken of the same
      specimen, intended to be all processed in the same way. In Bsoft, this
      is defined as a "project", and is tied to a specific specimen produced
      in a specific manner under a specific set of conditions. Changing one
      single parameter in the production of the specimen constitutes a new
      project.</p>
<p>There are several instances where multiple micrographs are taken
      of the same field. Common examples are focal series and tomographic tilt
      series. Within a project, there is a grouping level called a "field",
      which contains all micrographs from the same field (also called a
      "field-of-view").</p>
<p>In single particle analysis (SPA), small images of single
      particles in each micrograph are extracted for further processing. In
      tomography, a subfield may also be extracted and accessed at this
      level.</p>
<p>The micrograph parameter hierarchy is therefore:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><p>Project</p>
	<ul type="circle"><li><p>Field (Field-of-view)</p>
		<ul type="square"><li><p>Micrograph</p>
			<ul type="disc">
				<li><p>Particle</p></li>
				<li><p>Filament</p>
					<ul type="circle"><li><p>Filament node</p></li></ul>
				</li>
				<li><p>Structure factor</p></li>
				<li><p>Layer line</p></li>
				<li><p>Marker</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li></ul>
	</li></ul>
	<li><p>Reconstruction</p>
		<ul type="square"><li>
			<p>Particle</p></li>
			<li><p>Filament</p>
				<ul type="disc"><li><p>Filament node</p></li></ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>Structure factor</p></li>
			<li><p>Marker</p></li>
		</ul>
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>STAR files for micrograph parameters (extension .star)</h2>
<p>The STAR format defines a limited hierarchy, so that expressing
      the micrograph parameter hierarchy requires some specialized
      conventions. Each data block corresponds to a micrograph, and particle
      parameters are encoded in looped variables tightly linked to the
      original micrograph. Micrographs are identified by an "id" tag, and the
      fields-of-view they belong are identified by a "field_id" tag. Each
      particle is identified by a unique number, starting from 1 for the first
      particle in the micrograph:</p>
	<blockquote class="blockquote">
		<p>data_</p>
		<p>_micrograph.id                   &lt;a string&gt;</p>
		<p>_micrograph.field_id         &lt;a string&gt;</p>
		<p>loop_</p>
		<p>_particle.id</p>
		<p>&lt;numbers from 1 to n&gt;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Parameters for the micrograph proper are encoded as tags with
      single values, such as the micrograph file name, the acceleration
      voltage and CTF parameters. Parameters for the individual particle
      images picked from a micrograph are encoded in a table-like construct
      starting with the keyword "loop_" followed by the list of tags and
      columns of values. The first column should always be the particle number
      starting with the first particle as one and referencing all the
      particles in the picked particle file. Any selections of particles
      should be done using a selection column (not by deleting and rearranging
      the particle records). The loop must be followed by an empty line to
      indicate its end. The start of a STAR file (before any "data_" keywords)
      is used to record the history of the file. Every program writing a STAR
      file should add comments to the end of this section giving the date and
      time and the command line for execution. Additional comments can be
      inserted at any point.</p>

<br/>
<h2>XML files for micrograph parameters (extension .xml)</h2>
<p>The same tags used for the STAR files are used in XML files
	(without the initial underscore). The micrograph hierarchy is better
	represented due to the inherent structure of the XML syntax. </p>
<br/>
<h2>EMX (electron microscopy exchange files, extension .emx)</h2>
<p> Selected parameters from the micrograph hierarchy can be exported to and
	imported from EMX files for interchange with other software packages.
	Because this is an evolving standard, it is likely to experience
	significant changes</p>
