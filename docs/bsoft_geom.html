<h2>Geometry and Conventions</h2>
<p>Bsoft deals with real space objects, whether they are densities
    (encoded in images) or molecular structures. Understanding the conventions
    adopted in Bsoft is important to doing image and molecular processing
    effectively.</p>
<h2>Coordinate system</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><p>Orthogonal/Cartesian (exceptions are periodic cases such as
          crystals or helices, and spherical or cylindrical coordinate
          systems).</p></li>
<li><p>Right-handed (implicitly defining a right-handed rotation
          convention).</p></li>
<li><p>Default view is down the z-axis (vector {0,0,1}, with z values
          decreasing with distance from the viewer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The use of an orthogonal coordinate system may seem obvious, but
      non-orthogonal systems are used in fields such as crystallography, where
      certain mathematical operations are simplified by using non-orthogonal
      coordinate systems. Other alternatives include spherical and cylindrical
      coordinate systems. In the absence of mathematical utility, the simplest
      choice is an orthogonal or Cartesian system. The options of right-handed
      and left-handed coordinate systems are equivalent, with the choice going
      to the most commonly used one. The right-handed rotation implicit in a
      right-handed coordinate system is defined as a clockwise rotation around
      an axis, with the viewer looking in the positive direction of the axis.
      There are an infinite number of possibilities for the default view.
      Defining one of the major axes of the coordinate system as the default
      view direction, and placing the other two axes in vertical and
      horizontal directions, offers a finite number of possibilities. Two such
      views are common, both using the z-axis, but in opposite directions, and
      placing the x-axis horizontally and the y-axis vertically. The first
      convention views space in the positive z direction, i.e., z values
      increase with distance from the viewer (up the axis {0,0,1}). This
      convention is consistent with conventions in text and the arrangement of
      pixels on a computer monitor, i.e., start in the top-left corner and
      read row-by-row. The second convention views space in the negative z
      direction, which is a 180 degree rotation around the x-axis with respect
      to the first viewing convention (thus down the axis {0,0,1}). The worth
      of this convention is that it orients the x and y axes in the same way
      as one would do to plot a curve on a graph. Mathematical operations
      therefore become easier to understand from the user's point of
      view.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Discretization/digitization/sampling of space</h2>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>Independent sampling intervals along all the major axes are
          always defined {unit_x, unit_y, unit_z}.</p></li>
<li><p>The origin of any reference object is always considered to be
          {0,0,0} in real space.</p></li>
<li><p>The sampling unit is angstrom/voxel edge length.</p></li>
<li><p>The origin of this object within the image is therefore given
          as the location in voxel units, so that the real space coordinates
          in angstroms are always given by: real_x = ( x - origin_x ) *
          unit_x.</p></li></ul>
<p>Independent sampling intervals are supported because assumptions
      such as isotropic sampling are restrictive and does not allow a sensible
      treatment of cases where for instance the z-direction is not as well
      sampled as the other directions.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Rotations and views</h2>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>The direction of rotations is given as a change in the viewing
          orientation with respect to the scene or object coordinate
          frame.</p></li>
<li><p>The unit vector describing the viewing orientation is related
          to the reference vector as: view = R * ref_view, where the ref_view
          = {0,0,1}. Additionally, the rotation angle around the view vector
          needs to be given.</p></li>
<li><p>The Euler angles defined as R(psi,theta,phi) =
          R(psi)*R(theta)*R(phi) with the individual angles taken around the
          z-, y- and z-axes, respectively, are related to the view vector and
          rotation angle around that vector as:</p>
	<ul type="circle"><li><p>phi = arctan(view_y/view_x)</p></li>
	<li><p>theta = arccos(view_z)</p></li>
	<li><p>psi = angle - phi</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>Given Euler angles, the view vector and rotation angle is
          calculated as:</p>
	<ul type="circle"><li><p>view_x = cos(phi) * sin(theta)</p></li>
	<li><p>view_y = sin(phi) * sin(theta)</p></li>
	<li><p>view_z = cos(theta)</p></li>
	<li><p>angle = psi + phi</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>All calculations are passed through quaternion intermediates to
      avoid numerical instabilities in using Euler angles directly.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Origin: Placement of objects</h2>
<p>The origin of objects is always related to whatever symmetry it has:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>An object with any form of symmetry is oriented such that a
          symmetry axis is parallel to the z-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>The origin is defined as the point where several symmetry axes
          intersect, expressed as the offset from the first pixel or voxel in
          the image.</p></li></ul>
<h3>Point group symmetry</h3>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>A symmetry axis lies on the z-axis in all cases, in most it
            is the major symmetry axis.</p></li>
<li><p>The origin is defined as the point in the image grid where
            symmetry axes intersect and has pixel or voxel units.</p></li>
<li><p>Schoenflies notation is used to identify point
            groups.</p></li></ul>

<p>where &lt;n&gt; is the symmetry order of the major axis
            of the cyclic and dihedral point groups.</p><p>Icosahedral symmetry have two commonly used orientations:
            The front most 5-fold axes may lie in the yz plane (consistent
            with X-ray crystallographic convention), or they may lie in the xz
            plane (consistent with some EM packages, notably PFT and EM3DR).
            The first is the preferable orientation, indicated by the symbol
            I, while the second is 90 degrees rotated from the first and
            indicated by I90.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Helical symmetry</h3>
<p>Helical symmetry is indicated by up to five parts:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><p>Rise per asymmetric unit (translation along the helical axis
            oriented on the z-axis)</p></li>
<li><p>Rotation angle around the helical axis per asymmetric
            unit</p></li>
<li><p>Presence of a dyad axis (perpendicular to the helical axis
            and oriented on the x-axis)</p></li>
<li><p>Cyclic symmetry around the helical axis</p></li>
<li><p>Presence of seam and shift along the seam</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The notation is:
	H&lt;rise&gt;,&lt;angle&gt;,&lt;dyad&gt;,&lt;n&gt;,&lt;seam&gt;</p>
<br/>
<h3>Crystallographic symmetry</h3>
<p>Schoenflies notation and International Table numbers are used to
        identify space groups.</p>
