Reading a PIF image and structure factor file format\&. A 2D and 3D image format used in electron microscopy\&. There are two types of files: 
.IP "1." 4
A typical binary image format with a file header and a header for each sub-image\&.
.IP "2." 4
A binary structure factor format with the same file header as for the image format File header size: 512 bytes followed by optional 768 byte colour table Image header size: 512 bytes for each image File format extensions: \&.pif Identifier: supposed to be the first 8 bytes Byte order determination: Data type and third dimension values must be less than 256*256\&. Data types: 0 = byte, 1 = short, 2 = float, 3 = complex short, 4 = complex float\&. \fBTransform\fP type: List of structure factors\&. Note: To avoid endianness problems associated with different floating point formats (particularly those under VMS), this format was intended to store only integers\&. A 16 byte string following the 8th byte encodes a floating point conversion scale to convert an integer map and some of the fields in the header back to floating point\&. However, this format was designed in the CCP4/MRC style format, and the floating point data type was retained, as well as complex types used for transforms\&.
