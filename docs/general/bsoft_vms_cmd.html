      <h2>The Bsoft command line:<br />
      </h2>
      <h4> </h4>
The prototype command line for a Bsoft program is:<br />
      <div id="command"><p>program [options] files</p></div>
      <br />
      </div>
Typing only the program name produces usage information, describing the
intent of the program and the options that can be used. Each option
starts with a hyphen followed by a tag of one to several characters.
The user can use any truncated version of a tag as long as it is
unique. For options taking one or more values, the comma-separated list
of values must be separated from the tag by a space:<br />
      <div id="command"><p>-&lt;tag&gt; &lt;val1&gt;,&lt;val2&gt;,...</p></div>
      <br />
Data file formats are recognized by the file extension following the last
period (&quot;.&quot;) in the file name. A file can be read using a particular format
by specifying this format's extension after a colon (&quot;:&quot;), e.g.:
      <div id="command"><p>bimg -verbose 7 file.img:mrc file.img:tif</p></div>
	  <br/>
      <h3> VMS command line</h3>
On VMS machines, all command line characters are converted to lower case
before passing it to the program. Many options in the programs in the Bsoft
package are case sensitive, and usage as on unix-based systems implies
ambiguity for options where both upper and lower case letters are used.
The only mechanism to overcome this is to embed the options in quotes,
with each option getting its own set of quotes, e.g.:
      <div id="command"><p>bhisto &quot;-verbose 7&quot; &quot;-Histogram 300&quot; &quot;-datatype f&quot; file_in.img file_out.img</p></div>
      <p>In addition, the VMS command line is much more restrictive in
VMS than
in Unix, with the following additional problems: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>File name expansion or globbing when using wild cards in file names does
not work as in Unix.</li>
        <li>The VMS command line limit is only 256 characters, much
shorter than that for Unix.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Bview: Image display</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The &quot;bview.com&quot; script </span>
      uses the program &quot;bmontage&quot; to generate
a montage of the slices of a 3D image or a set of 2D images and the program
&quot;display&quot; from the Image Magick package to display it
      <p>3D map file: </p>
      <div id="command"><p>@bview -slices 0,0 2omf.grd</p></div>
      <p>2D multi-image file: </p>
      <div id="command"><p>@bview -images 0,0 file.pif</p></div>
      This requies the Image Magick package to be installed.
