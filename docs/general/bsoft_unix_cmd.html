<h2>The Bsoft command line</h2>
<p>The prototype command line for a Bsoft program is:<br />
<div id="command"><p>program [options] files</p></div>
<p>Typing only the program name produces usage information, describing the
intent of the program and the options that can be used. Each option
starts with a hyphen followed by a tag of one to several characters.
The user can use any truncated version of a tag as long as it is
unique. For options taking one or more values, the comma-separated list
of values must be separated from the tag by a space:</p>
<div id="command"><p>-&lt;tag&gt; &lt;val1&gt;,&lt;val2&gt;,...</p></div>

<h3>Unix command line</h3>
<p>Bsoft programs are designed to conform to Unix-style command lines, starting
with the program name, followed by any number of options to set parameters,
and ending with data file names, e.g., to truncate the data in an image
between the values 0 and 100 and with verbose output:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bimg -verbose 7 -truncate 0,100 input.img output.img</p></div>
<p>Option tags are words aiming at describing the action or parameter
to be set. The user can truncate these tags as long as they remain
unique within the context of a program. E.g., &quot;-v 7&quot; will set the
verbosity level to 7 in most programs, as long as no other tag for
those programs begin with a &quot;v&quot;. There must be a space between the
option tag and the value.</p>

<h3> Data file recognition</h3>
<p>Data file formats are recognized by the file extension following the last
period (&quot;.&quot;) in the file name. A file can be read using a particular format
by specifying this format's extension after a colon (&quot;:&quot;), e.g.:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bimg -verbose 7 file.img:mrc file.img:tif</p></div>

<h2>Scripts</h2>
<h3>Brun: Command line construction aid</h3>
<p>Brun is a Tcl/Tk script which presents the options and data I/O of a program
in a graphical user interface for ease of command line construction.
Here is a quick example to show the header parameters in an image file:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To start the script, type &quot;brun&quot;.</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;Program&quot; button, select the program &quot;/usr/local/bsoft/bin/bhead&quot;.</li>
	<li>Click the top &quot;Browse&quot; button and select an image file.</li>
	<li>Click the check box next to &quot;input.img&quot;. This adds the file
		name to the command line.</li>
	<li>Click the check box next to &quot;-verbose&quot; to insert this
		option with its current value into the command line.</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;Execute&quot; button, which should result in an
		output of the image header parameters in the C-shell window.</li>
</ul>
<p>On MacOSX there is a little wrapper script that needs to be run called
  &quot;brunX&quot;. </p>

<h3><a href="../bshow/bshow.html">Bshow: Image display and manipulation</a></h3>
<p>Bshow is a Tcl/Tk script tightly interfaced with the Bsoft library to be
able to display images and do many interactive processing tasks. The main
documentation is <a href="../bshow/bshow.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="../scripts/bsoft_scripts.html">Other scripts</a></h3>
<p>Many processing tasks can be broken up into subtasks and executed on
different processors or on one processor at different times to avoid exceeding
memory limitations.</p>
