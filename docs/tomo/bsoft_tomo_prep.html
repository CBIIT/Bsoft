<h1>Preparation for tilt series alignment and reconstruction</h1>

<h2>1. Parameter file structure</h2>
<p>A tomographic tilt series is represented in a parameter file in Bsoft as a
  single field-of-view with multiple micrographs, one for each image. 
  The best approach is to have a tilt series in one image file making sure
  it is specified as a multiple images, not slices of a 3D image.
  The programs <b>bhead, bimg and bnorm</b> have an
  option to convert 3D slices into a stack of 2D images for multi-image
  formats, and the program <b>btomo</b> automatically does the conversion.
  In addition, it is good to set the pixel size (sampling) and have
  all the statistical parameters properly calculated.
  The simplest way is to just run the image through <b>bhead</b>
  prior to any further operations:</p>
  <p><div id="command">bhead -v 7 -images -sampling 5 -recalc gold3.pif gold3.mrc</div></p>
<p>For practice, download the following tilt series and try the different
	operations for tomography:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="gold3.mrc" type="application/octet-stream">gold3.mrc</a>
<p>Open it in <b>bshow</b> to get the following display:

</center>

<br />

<h2>Tilt geometry convention</h2>

</center>
<p>The tilt axis angle (red arrow) is defined as the angle relative to the 
	x-axis and rotating anti-clockwise. The rotation around the tilt axis 
	(red dashed line) is right-handed (blue arrow), so that the normal 
	to the specimen plane rotates from negative to positive 
	tilt angles. The normal to the specimen plane (dotted blue line)
	progresses from negative to positive tilt angles, from left to right
	(for a tilt axis close to the y-axis or 90&#730;) or top to bottom (for a
	tilt axis close to the x-axis or 0&#730;). </p>
<br />
<h2>2. Setting the initial parameters</h2>
<p>The initial parameters can be set up in a number of ways. The following
sections detail three ways of doing it.</p>
<h3>a. Using a SerialEM mdoc file</h3>
<p>The program <b>SerialEM</b> is commonly used to acquire tilt series
	on electron microscopes.
	It produduces a text output file ending with the extension .mdoc.
	Bsoft programs can parse this file into its own internal parameter
	data base, setting up all the initial parameters. Note that the 
	specification of the tilt axis angle in SerialEM is relative to the
	y-axis, while in Bsoft it is relative to the x-axis, giving a 90Â° 
	difference.</p>
<p>Set up a new parameter file with <b>btomo</b>:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>btomo -verb 7 -lambda 2200 -out RS1_G6_01.star RS1_G6_01.mrc.mdoc</p></div>
<p>The -lamda parameter allows the estimation of the tomogram thickness, as
described below. For fiducialless alignment, the btomaln program can read
a .mdoc file directly and do the alignment without any other setup.</p>

<h3>b. On the command line from an image file</h3>
<p>Some of the initial parameters can be set up with <b>btomo</b>
	starting from a tilt series of images:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btomo -v 7 -sampling 1.75 -axis 87.5 -tilt -60,3 -gold 22 -out
RS1_G6_01.star RS1_G6_01.mrc</p></div>
</p>
  
<h3>c. Using bshow</h3>
<p>All of the initial parameters can be set up in <b>bshow</b>:
  <div id="command">bshow RS1_G6_01.mrc</div></p>
<p>
  Set the following parameters:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enter the correct pixel size in the main window</li>
  <li>Select the menu item &quot;Micrograph/Tomography&quot; (see picture below)</li>
  <li>If the tilt series contain fiducial markers, enter the fiducial marker radius in pixels</li>
  <li>Enter the tilt axis angle</li>
  <li>Enter the tilt angles:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Select the menu item &quot;Tomography/Set tilt angles&quot; 
    	and enter the the starting angle and the angular increment.</li>
    <li>or select the menu item &quot;Tomography/Read rawtlt
      file&quot; and read the angles from a *.rawtlt file</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

</center>

<h2>3. Aligning and summing frames</h2>
<p>If each micrograph in the tilt series was acquired as multiple frames,
	they should be aligned and summed prior to any further operations.

	 style="width: 500px;" alt="Frame alignment dialog"
	 src="tomo_aln_frames.png" /><br />
	</center>

<h2>3. Thickness estimation</h2>
<p>The change in micrograph intensity can be used to estimate the thickness
	of the specimen, given a proportionality parameter, lambda (&Lambda;). 
	This parameter is often referred to as the "mean free path", but is not
	necessarily a true reflection of the mean distance between electron
	scattering events. Lambda is typically calibrated for a given microscope,
	acceleration voltage and imaging settings. The average intensity of
	a micrograph for a tilted specimen is given by:</p>
<center><img
 style="width: 200px;" alt="Thickness equation"
 src="tomo_thickness_eq.png" /><br />
</center>
<p>where I<sub>db</sub> is the direct beam intensity, t is the average 
	specimen thickness, &alpha; is the nominal tilt angle, and 
	&alpha;<sub>st</sub> is the specimen tilt angle for the 
	nominal zero-degree micrograph.</p>
<p>The parameter -lambda can be provided with several programs (btomo, btomaln)
	to estimate a specimen thickness. In the absence of a good value for it,
	the thickness-to-lambda ratio is calculated to allow for later calculation
	of the thickness once the appropriate value of lambda is established.
	With an appropriate value for lambda, the thickness can be estimated
	as follows:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btomo -verb 7 -lambda 2200 -Post gold3_thick.ps gold3_aln.star</p></div>
<p>An additional benefit of this analysis is that it gives an estimate of
	how much the specimen is tilted. The tilt angles are corrected
	to compensate for the specimen tilt. The -Postscript option generates
	a plot of the intensity change as well as the fit:
<center><img
 style="width: 500px;" alt="Thickness plot"
 src="tomo_thickness.png" /><br />
</center>
<p>In the <b>Tomography</b> window in <b>bshow</b>,
	there is a "Thickness" entry. Click
	on the "Fit intensities" button to calculate the new specimen thickness.
	A dialog box will open with several options to do the fit. Set the lambda
	parameter to an appropriate value or click the button to estimate
	it from first principles. Check whether the result will be
	used to adjust the tilt angles. Finally, eneter a Postcript file name
	to generate a file with plot of intensities and fit. This file can
	be displayed with the "Open" button in an external display program
	(Preview on Mac OSX and ghostscript on Linux).</p>

<h2>4. Normalization</h2>
<p>In the traditional preparation of a tilt series, it was recommended to
	normalize the images to compensate for contrast variations.
	This is particularly important with film, where the dynamic range 
	can vary considerably. With CCD cameras, it is less of an issue but 
	still useful to render the contrast in images to a similar scale.
	With direct detectors, the more accurate representation of the
	signal makes it unnecessary to normalize the images. More 
	importantly, the better reflection of actual counts means that the
	images are already properly weighted and should not be normalized.
	Note that normalization would also remove the information
	required for thickness estimation as described in the previous section.</p>
<p>If normalization is still desired, it can be done in several ways.
	The first is simply setting all the images to the same average and 
	standard deviation:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bnorm -v 7 -rescale 127,10 -data byte -out gold3.star gold3.mrc gold3_norm.mrc</p></div>
<p>The second is to fit the central part
  of the histogram of each micrograph to a Gaussian function,
  and rescale it to a given average and standard deviation:<br />
  <br />
  <div id="command"><p>bnorm -v 7 -type Gauss -rescale 0,1 -data float -out gold3.star gold3.mrc
  gold3_norm.mrc</p></div>
<p>Alternatively, the normalization can also be done using a previously generated parameter file:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bnorm -v 7 -rescale 127,10 -data byte -out gold3_norm.star gold3.star</p></div>
  <br />
