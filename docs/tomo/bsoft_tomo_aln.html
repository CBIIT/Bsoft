<h1>Tomographic series alignment without fiducials</h1>
<p>Tomographic reconstructions without fiducial markers are always of lesser
	quality than with markers. However, it is valuable in many situations
	where the addition of markers to a specimen may be problematic.
	The tilt axis and tilt angles must be known to a good accuracy.
	Because the tilt axis is fixed for a specific microscope installation,
	it can be determined by doing a fiducial-based tilt series
	of any arbitrary specimen (such as gold particles on carbon).
	</p>
<p>The algorithm here attempts to do subset reconstructions to improve 
	the signal-to-noise ratio for cross-correlation. It does this iteratively
	to improve the alignment.</p>
<p>As stated in the page on preparation, the .mdoc files produced from SerialEM
	can be used directly in Bsoft. Alternatively, all the parameters can be
	set up as on the <a href="bsoft_tomo_prep.html">preparation page</a>.
	The fastest way of aligning the tilt series is one command line:</p>
<div id="command"><p>btomaln -verb 1 -align 3,1,3 -resol 20 -edge 20,3 -lambda 2165 -out 20190117_RS1_G6_10_aln.star 20190117_RS1_G6_10.mrc.mdoc</p></div>
<p>The -align option takes three parameters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Number of iterations: These are iterations over the full tilt series
		attempting to refine the micrograph orientations</li>
	<li>Stopping condition: Sets the threshold to stop when the average 
		micrograph shift difference compared to the pervious iteration 
		drops below it.
	<li>Number of adjacent micrographs to include in each subset reconstruction.
</ul>
<p>The -resolution option sets the high resolution limit for cross correlations</p>
<p>The edge option smooths the edges of the micrographs which includes erasing
	extraneous areas at high tilts. The parameters are the width of the edge
	and the standard deviation of the transition, both in pixels</p>
<p>The -lambda option specifies the proportionality parameter for estimating the
	thickness (see the <a href="bsoft_tomo_prep.html">section on thickness</a>).</p>
<p>As with other operations, the alignment can be done from <b>bshow</b>.
	Select the "Workflow/Align micrographs" item to obtain the fllowing dialog
	window:<p>
	<center><img
	 style="width: 500px;" alt="Alignment dialog"
	 src="tomo_aln_mg.png" /><br />
	</center>
<p>The output is written to a text window that can be saved using the
"File" menu.</p>
<p>At this stage the results are not yet in
<b>bshow</b> memory. Close the text window and click
on the "Load" button in the "AlignMicrographs" window to load the new
parameter file in memory.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Sometimes the alignment fails. While the program attempts to deal with every eventuality,
it must make some assumptions regading the state of the input information. One possibility
is that the direction of initial alignment biases it. To change the order in which alignment
takes place, set the 180Â° to the tilt axis angle. Just be aware that this will change the
eventual handedness of the reconstruction. </p>
<p>Another approach is to place markers on recognizable structures. Place one or more markers
on the zero-tilt micrograph and then use the "Workflow/Generate markers from seed" menu item
to produce the corresponding markers on the other micrographs. These can then be re-positioned
and the alignment parameters refined (<a href="bsoft_tomo_fid.html">Fiducial markers</a>).
