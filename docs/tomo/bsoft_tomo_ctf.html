<h2>Determining the CTF</h2>
<p>For a general introduction to the contrast transfer function (CTF) see this
<a href="../spa/bsoft_ctf.html">link</a>.
</p>
<p>A prerequisite is that the tilt axis and tilt angles are known to a reasonable
	accuracy. The nominal axis and tilt angles should be sufficient to get
	good power spectra for CTF fitting. The more accurate angles determined
	from alignment is then used during reconstruction.</p>
<p>As with micrographs processed for SPA, the image is tiled, each tile transformed,
and the resulting power spectra averaged to give a relatively noise-suppressed spectrum.
The complication is to adjust for the specimen tilt that causes a defocus gradient
across the image. The tilt angles and tilt axis must therefore be specified in the
parameter file to calculate the correct defocus for each tile. The best workflow
is to align the tilt series first to get accurate tilt and axis angles. In addition,
an approximate defocus for the whole tilt series need to be given. The CTF parameters
are then determined for each micrograph in the tilt series. If the nominal defocus
provided in the beginning is too far off the determined values, the whole process
can be repeated with the defocus values in the parameter file.</p>
<p>The following command line will set up the initial CTF parameters, prepare the
average power spectra, and determine CTF parameters:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bctf -verb 1 -act prepfit -tile 256,256,1 -Volt 300 -Defocus 2.6 -Amp 0.07 -resol 10,50 -out tomo_ctfit.star tomo.star</p></div>
<p>The tile size should be chosen to give reasonable Thon rings in the power spectra.
	The tile edge size should be:</p>

</center>
	
<p>As always with CTF fitting, the quality of the fits should be checked in bshow.</p>

<h2>Correcting for the CTF</h2>
<p>The CTF of the micrographs can be corrected before or during
	<a href="bsoft_tomo_rec.html">reconstruction</a>.
	The same types of CTF correction are available in both cases.</p>
<p>The CTF can be corrected in several ways, from the conservative flipping phase
to the most aggressive correction algorithms. A good choice (at least to start with)
 is to flip the phases where the CTF curve is negative:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bctf -verb 1 -act flip -tile 128,128,1 -mic -out tomo_flip.star tomo_ctfit2.star</p></div>
<p>The tile size for CTF correction should be relatively small, but not too small
to avoid poor spectral sampling. It may be necessary to find a good size for a
particular case or a particular tomographic setup.</p>
