<h1>Single Particle Analysis - Resolution-limited version</h1>
<h2>1. Background</h2>
<p>Limiting the resolution considered for aligning the particle images
aims at using only high-quality information in the reference map.
The low resolution limit cuts out low frequencies with little orientation
information but strong intensities. The high resolution limit excludes
high frequency noise that could compromise the alignment. When the resolution
of the reconstruction is determined, significant information beyond
the high resolution limit used should be apparent. If the FSC curve
drops close to the high resolution limit, it is likely that the images
are noise images or that the reference used is inappropriate.</p>
<p>The reconstruction from one iteration of alignment is typically used as
reference for the next iteration. The high resolution limit should be chosen
based on the FSC curve associated with this reference map. A typical choice
is the resolution where the FSC curve is still above 0.7 or 0.8. This
guideline can be used to automatically pick the high resolution limit.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="bsoft_spa_prep.html">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>The preparation for this workflow (CTF fitting and particle picking) is the
same as for the typical SPA. The descriptions for orientation determination
and reconstruction also apply, with the exceptions noted below.</p>
<br />
<h2>3. Determining particle orientations</h2>
<p>A reference map consistent with the size of the particle images is required. This map can be from a previous reconstruction of the same type of particles, a map generated from an atomic structure, or a synthetic map generated from geometric shapes (see the <a href="../general/bsoft_synmap.html">Synthetic Map</a> part for more information).</p>
There are two programs for particle alignment: borient and brefine. borient
does a global search of orientations in the asymmetric unit while brefine
improves the already existing orientations locally.
  <br />
  <h3>a. borient:</h3>
  <p>For each run of orientation-finding, create one directory such as run1,
  run2, etc. Change to the next run directory and launch borient to
  determine particle orientations:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>borient -v 1 -sym D5 -angle 2 -resol 25,150 -ann 10,90 -mode ccc -CTF -ref
  klh_ref.pif -out klh_run1.star ../klh_ctf.star &gt; klh_run1.log &amp;</p></div>
  <p>Depending on the particle size and the search grid (determined by the option -angles), this
  can run for a long time (smaller angles mean more projections and
  longer runtimes).</p>
  <p>The algorithm in borient determines the orientations of the particles
  using a reference-based projection-matching algorithm. Projection
  images are produced from a reference map for all views within the
  asymmetric unit for the specified point group. For every comparison of
  a particle image to a projection image, the best matching in-plane
  rotation angle and the best particle origin are determined. The
  in-plane rotation matching is done by using polar images of both the
  projection and the particle. Because this is dependent on the origin if
  done in real space, the first determination of the in-plane rotation
  angle is done on polar power spectra of the projection and the
  particle. The projection is rotated by the in-plane rotation angle and
  cross-correlated with the particle to find the first estimate of the
  origin. This provides a reasonable origin for generating the polar
  image of the particle, which is then used to find the next estimate of
  the in-plane rotation angle. The origin and angle determinations are
  done iteratively until the result stabilizes (typically only 2-4
  iterations). The projection image giving the best correlation
  coefficient for a specific particle image determines the view
  parameters for that particle. The key parameters are the angular
  increments between views (option -angles; typically 0.5 &#8211; 3&#730;), the
  annuli used for the real space polar image matching (option -annuli;
  usually include the whole particle image) and the resolution limits for
  reciprocal space polar image matching and cross-correlation (option
  -resolution). A particular range of annuli can be specified for
  determining the in-plane rotation angle, allowing exclusion of
  especially the center of the particle which may not contribute to an
  accurate determination of this angle.</p>
  <p>The output from orientation-finding is a new parameter file with the
  following new parameters for the best fit of the particle images to the
  projection images:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Particle origins</li>
  <li>Particle views</li>
  <li>FOMs: Figures-of-merit based on the correlation coefficient for
the bets fit</li>
  <li>Projection index for the best fit: this appears in the selection
column <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The orientation-finding should only be run once per reference map,
because the existing parameters in the input parameter files are not
used in subsequent runs. (The reason is that iterative refinement has
already been incorporated in borient and multiple runs on the same
reference map will just give the same results.)</p>
<h3>b. brefine</h3>
<p>After a previous run to find the rough particle orientations in the
asymmetric unit, brefine can be used to improve the orientations locally.
It is run the same way as borient, typically in a new directory:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>brefine -v 1 -grid 2,0.2 -res 20 -mag 0.03 -defocus 0.002 -kernel 6,2 -ref
  ../run1/klh_run1.pif -out klh_run2.star ../run1/klh_run1.star &gt; klh_run2.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>The refinement algorithm runs in reciprocal space, extracting a central section
from the Fourier transform of the reference map with kernel-based interpolation.
The central section is then compared with the particle transform and a figure-of-measure (FOM)
calculated (-fomtype option) to the specified resolution (-resolution option).
This comparison is repeated in a small grid around the current view,
starting at an initial stepsize and contracting around the best solution
to a minimum step size (the step sizes are the two values for option -grid).
Refinement of the magnification can also be turned on, specifying the maximum
adjustment in magnification to consider (-magnification option).</p>
<p>brefine can be run in a different mode:</p>
  <div id="command"><p>brefine -v 1 -monte 10 -res 25 -defocus 0.002 -kernel 8,2 -ref
  ../run1/klh_run1.pif -out klh_run2.star ../run1/klh_run1.star &gt; klh_run2.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>Here the orientation parameters are adjusted using a Monte Carlo approach to
find views close to the input that improve the FOM's. The more iterations are run
(value for the -monte option) the more likely that good solutions will be found,
but at the cost of longer runs. The extent of changes in this algorithm can
controlled through the options -shift, -view and -angle.</p>
<br />
<h2>4. Particle selection</h2>
<p>The selection of particles for reconstruction can be done in several
ways.</p>
a. Particles can be selected by the correlation coefficients (FOMs)
generated during
orientation-finding:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -fom 0.34 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
b. The FOMs are typically related to the defocus, and this can be used
to select particles with a varying FOM cutoff based on a linear fit
between the FOM and defocus values. This is turned on by adding a flag
to the &quot;-fom&quot; option:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -fom 0.2,1 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
c. A given percentage of the particles ranked by FOMs can be selected:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -top 70 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
d. The FOM cutoff for selection can be based on the standard deviation
of the FOMs:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -deviation -1.5 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
e. The FOMs can be ranked and grouped into sets of decreasing FOMs to
be able to generate several reconstructions:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bpartsel -v 7 -all -rank 5 -out klh_run1_sel.star klh_run1.star</p></div>
<br />
There are several other particle selection schemes that can also be
used.<br />
<br />
<h2>5. Reconstruction</h2>
The reconstruction can then be done from the selected particles.
Typically, two maps from different halves of the selected particles
need to be generated to determine resolution. These two maps can be added
afterwards to give the full map. The program breconstruct has several options
to do the reconstruction in different ways, depending on the desired outcome
as well as the capabilities of the computer being used. Here are a few cases:</p>
<h3>a. A simple reconstruction:</h3>
<p>The main decision is to what resolution the reconstruction should be calculated:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -CTF baseflip -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<h3>b. Two half set reconstructions and a full set reconstruction:</h3>
<p>All three maps can be calculated at the same time:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -CTF baseflip -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>The resultant maps from the half sets have the inserts &quot;_01&quot; and &quot;_02&quot; before
the extension. These maps can be added to generate a single reconstruction
that is the same as the full set map:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bop -v 7 -add 1,0 klh_run1_01.pif klh_run1_02.pif klh_run1.pif</p></div>
<h3>c. Threaded reconstruction:</h3>
<p>If Bsoft was compiled with OpenMP and FFTW3 support, the reconstruction can be run with multiple threads:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -threads 8 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -CTF baseflip -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>Be aware that this is very memory-intensive, requiring 20 times the map volume per thread.
For example, a map of size 500^3 will require about 2.5 Gb per thread.</p>
<h3>d. Selected reconstructions:</h3>
<p>Reconstructions can also be done from specific selection numbers in
the parameter file using the &quot;-classes&quot; option:</p>
<div id="command"><p>breconstruct -v 3 -resol 15 -full -half -classes 1,3-5 -threads 2 -rescale 0,1 -sym D5 -CTF baseflip -recon
klh_run1.pif klh_run1_sel.star &gt;&amp; klh_run1_rec.log &amp;</p></div>
<p>In this case the threads are per class, and for calculating halfmaps in each class, the number of threads should be even.
Because of memory limitations, it is likely better to specify only one class per run.</p>
<br />
<h2>6. Resolution determination</h2>
The two reconstructions are then compared to determine the resolution:<br />
<br />
<div id="command"><p>bresolve -v 7 -resol 15 -align 25 -Post klh_run1_resol.ps -map klh_run1_01.pif klh_run1_02.pif</p></div>
<p>The -align option should indicate the resolution limit used in the particle alignment.
The resolution curves for FSC (Fourier shell correlation) and DPR
(differential phase residual) are written into the postscript file in
such a way that it can be opened in a graphing program that can
interpret text files (Kaleidagraph or Excel).</p>
<br />
<h2>7. FSC filtering of reconstructions:</h2>
<p>The FSC curve can be used to do an appropriate filtering of the reconstructions
to more accurately represent the actual information content:</p>
<div id="command"><p>bampweigh -v 7 -FSC klh_run3_resol.xml -resolution 15 -rescale 0,1 klh_run3.pif klh_run3_fsc.pif`</p></div>
